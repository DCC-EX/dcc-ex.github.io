EX-RAIL Reference
*********************

.. attention:: EX-RAIL is in Beta testing. It is very far along, but you may experience unexpected issues. We can use your help in final testing and ideas for new features. Please see us on Discord to participate in the Beta, and get the link to the EX-RAIL version of the software.


Notes
========


- *ROUTE*, *AUTOMATION* and *SEQUENCE* use the same ID number space, so a ``FOLLOW(n)`` command can be used for any of them.

- Sensors and outputs used by AT/AFTER/SET/RESET/LATCH/UNLATCH/SERVO/IF/IFNOT refer directly to Arduino pins, and those handled by I2C expansion.

- Signals also refer directly to pins, and the signal ID (for RED/AMBER/GREEN) is always the same as the RED signal pin.

- It's OK to use sensor IDs that have no physical item in the layout. These can only be LATCHed, tested (IF/IFNOT), or UNLATCHed in the scripts. If a sensor is latched by the script, it can only be unlatched by the scriptâ€¦ so ``AT(35) LATCH(35)`` for example, effectively latches sensor 35 on when detected once.

- All IDs used in commands and functions will be numbers, or an ALIAS name if configured.

Diagnostics & Control
----------------------

There are some diagnostic and control commands added to the <tag> language normally used to control the Command Station over USB, WiFi or Ethernet. 

.. list-table::

    :header-rows: 1

    * - *Command*
      - *Function*
    * - <D EXRAIL ON|OFF>

    * - </ PAUSE>
      - Pauses all automation - all locos ESTOP
    * - </ RESUME>
      - Resumes all automation - all locos are restarted at speed when paused
    * - </ >
      - Displays EX-RAIL running task information
    * - </ ROUTES>
      - Returns the Routes & Automations control list in WiThrottle format. **JMRI integration only!**
    * - </START [loco_addr] route_id>
      - Starts a new task to send a loco onto a Route, or activate a non-loco Animation or Sequence
    * - </ KILL task_id>
      - Kills a currently running script task by ID (use ``</ >`` to list task IDs) 
    * - </ RESERVE block_id>

    * - </ FREE block_id>
      - Manually frees a virtual track Block
    * - </ LATCH sensor_id>
