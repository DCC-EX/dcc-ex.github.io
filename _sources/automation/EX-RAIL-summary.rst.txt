EX-RAIL Command Summary
*************************


Notes
========


- *AUTOMATION*, *ROUTE*, and *SEQUENCE* use the same ID number space, so a ``FOLLOW(n)`` command can be used for any of them.
- Sensors and outputs used by AT/AFTER/SET/RESET/LATCH/UNLATCH/SERVO/IF/IFNOT refer directly to Arduino pins, and those handled by I2C expansion.
- Signals also refer directly to pins, and the signal ID (for RED/AMBER/GREEN) is always the same as the RED signal pin.
- It's OK to use sensor IDs that have no physical item in the layout. These can only be LATCHed, tested (IF/IFNOT), or UNLATCHed in the scripts. If a sensor is latched by the script, it can only be unlatched by the scriptâ€¦ so ``AT(35) LATCH(35)`` for example, effectively latches sensor 35 on when detected once. Only sensors with ID's 0 to 255 may be LATCHED/UNLATCHED in your script.
- All IDs used in commands and functions will be numbers, or an ALIAS name if configured.
- Most IDs simply need to be unique, however RESERVE/FREE and LATCH/UNLATCH must be in the range 0 - 255.

Diagnostics & Control
