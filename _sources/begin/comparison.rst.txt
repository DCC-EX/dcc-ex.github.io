Introduction
============

A common question we see is why should someone choose our |EX-CS| over the many commercial systems that are available. This page is a *brief discussion* of some of the advantages and disadvantages of |EX-CS| and the whole |DCC-EX| ecosystem. (To see a detailed list of specific features of various systems we would recommend looking at the `DCC Wiki <https://dccwiki.com/Command_Stations_List>`_.)

First and foremost, there is nothing fundamentally wrong with any of the commercial offerings. While we believe strongly in our products, the commercial systems do have some advantages that we don't quite match. (See below.) So we fully understand that the |EX-CS| is not necessarily the best option for everyone.


Areas of Comparison
-------------------

This page will compare the following areas in broad a generic terms:

Cost
^^^^

Hands down, the |EX-CS| is the lowest cost DCC Command Station option available. 

Depending on the configuration you choose, the least expensive commercial system will be three, or more, times more expensive than a |EX-CS|.  Also, it won't have a fraction of the built in features (see below) that the |EX-CS| has, which you will likely have to pay additionally for in the commercial systems.

Purchasing
^^^^^^^^^^

This is one area where the commercial systems win out. 

You can walk into store and pick up a commercial Command Station in a box with comprehensive manuals and know that it is all there and that will work first time.

With the |EX-CS|, while we now have sellers that can supply a complete system, most people purchase parts from different suppliers online.  This can therefore take some time to arrive, and there have been issues occasionally with poorly manufactured boards. So in general it is not as plug-and-play.

|hr-dashed|

Setup complexity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The commercial systems are ahead here.

Unless you purchased a complete system from one of our resellers, along with the purchasing process the commercial systems are a *lot simpler* to setup.

Loading the software, assembling the boards, making a case, etc. while not individually difficult steps, can be still be daunting for some people. Conversely, for some this becomes part of the attraction/challenge.  Like the building a kit loco or building.  Some people enjoy it, some don't.  

Note: A common comment made is *"..but I don't know how to program..."*.  This is a common misconception. You DO NOT have to know anything about programming to setup an |EX-CS|.  If you can join rail/track together, then you can assemble an |EX-CS|.

Usability
^^^^^^^^^

Once the systems are setup, there is generally not a lot of difference in terms of usability between the commercial systems and an |EX-CS|.

While not functionally different, the area of greatest difference is that most of the commercial system come with some form of physical controller.  Most |EX-CS| owners use inexpensive or hand-me-down smart phones to control their locos.

You can have/use physical controllers (not a phone, tablet or computer) with |EX-CS|, but that is an additional item to build or purchase.  Note that there are multiple inexpensive physical throttle designs that you can build yourself.

Built in Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here the |EX-CS| wins hands down.

DCC *and DC* loco control, Auto-Reverser, WiFi throttles, Rosters, |EX-R|, |JMRI| connectivity via WiFi or USB, and other features that are built into |EX-CS| that *generally* require additional addons to the Commercial Systems.  For example, I can think of one brand, where the USB connectivity add-on alone is more expensive the an entire |EX-CS|.

However, there are features that a built into some of the commercial systems that are not exactly *built into* the |EX-CS|, including:

- CV programming  (|EX-CS| requires the use of |ED|, |JMRI| or |EX-WT| which, while are all free, require additional hardware.)
- FastClock
- *Simple to use* Advanced Consisting

|hr-dashed|

Options/Expansion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|EX-CS| fares very well in this space.

Over and above the built in features (above), the |EX-CS| supports IoTT connectivity, |EX-TT|, |EX-IO|, with more to come.  |DCC-EX| is evolving on a daily basis. (See Community below.)

Having said that, most of the commercial system have different expansion options. However, some of these only go to fill in the features that come out of the box with the |EX-CS|.  In their favour they are generally plug and play, whereas the |DCC-EX| options require some tinkering.

|hr-dashed|

Support
^^^^^^^

This is more of a mixed bag.

With commercial systems you are more-or-less guaranteed quality support, replacement for faulty items, etc. The catch is that depending on where you are in the world and where the manufacturer is, there can be long turnarounds to get that support.  Even longer to get replacements or repairs.

Because members of the |DCC-EX| team are located world-wide, there is usually someone that can help you within a few hours on our `Discord Server <https://discord.gg/sWNPUsg8>`_. 

However, in terms of replacement/repairs, unless you purchased through one of our resellers, it is up to you to deal with this side of the process.  The positive is that, if you wish, the costs are so low that you can keep spares of most items and still be well under the total cost of a commercial system.

|hr-dashed|

Community
^^^^^^^^^

|DCC-EX| is the winner here.

While the commercial systems have strong followings, and there are plenty of people on various forums that will be happy to discuss the systems or provide help, they can't compare to the |DCC-EX| community.

|DCC-EX| maintains a `Discord Server <https://discord.gg/sWNPUsg8>`_ where hundreds of people world-wide are actively engaged in discussing and evolving the |EX-CS| and it add-ons.  You can generally get answers to questions within a few hours and, if you interested, you easily find yourself in deep conversations about existing and upcoming features. 

The other aspect of |DCC-EX| that should not be glossed over lightly is that it is all *open source*. Everyone is free to use or modify our code and designs as they see fit, for non-commercial use. This shows clearly in the volume and rate of features and options being continuously added by the team. We actively invite, encourage and support people who want to add to the products.

Conclusion
==========

As you can see from the points above and the `DCC Wiki <https://dccwiki.com/Command_Stations_List>`_ it is *not* a black-and-white comparison. 

Before proceeding with any system you should weigh up the pros and cons and come to a decision *you* feel comfortable with.
