Documentation
=============

Thank you for your offer to help. Here's some instructions for how to contribute. You might want to check in with
an admin from the DCC++ EX team before working on documentation changes to identify current needs.

Submission Procedure
--------------------

We will assume that you have an appropriate text editor and Git installed on your machine. We recommend the free _Visual Studio Code IDE (VSC)_ and _GitHub Desktop_ or _Git Bash_.

1. Clone the [dcc-ex.github.io](https://github.com/DCC-EX/dcc-ex.github.io/tree/sphinx) repository, to your local machine. Make sure you're on the sphinx branch. ([Cloning a repository in GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository))
2. Install _Python 3.8.x_ (which also installs pip) then use pip to install the required packages ```pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme sphinxcontrib-spelling```
3. Using Git Bash, go to the "website" folder and make a branch using GitHub desktop or this command: ```git checkout -b your-branch-name```
4. Open VSC and edit the files in the ```dcc-ex.github.io/docs``` folder. Save, then Preview your changes by running ```make github``` from the root of the ```dcc-ex.github.io``` folder. *This must be done from cmd.exe in windows, not powershell* Then go to the directory ```dcc-ex.github.io/docs/build/html``` and open ```index.html``` in Chrome or another browser. Note that since 11/23/2020, this is just a local preview - when you push your changes GitHub will automatically rebuild your website.
5. Use ```git add``` and ```git commit -m "MY CHANGE DESCRIPTION"``` often to save changes. If you're using GitHub desktop these are combined in the commit button.
6. Push it to GitHub: ```git push origin {your-name}-changes```
8. Go to GitHub and issue a pull request for your branch to be pulled into the sphinx branch. Once it's merged in by one of the admins, your changes will go live!
