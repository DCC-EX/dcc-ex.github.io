How We Use Donations
======================

Your donations help to offset the cost of running some of the resources used to operate DCC-EX and bring you new software and hardware. Your generosity funds the purchasing of technology we use in testing to add new features such as motor drivers, the latest microcontrollers, expansion boards, and similar items. At the end of the year, if there is any money left over, a few of the key contributors for that year may receive a small gift certificate to their favorite coffee shop or train store to thank them personally for their efforts. We truly appreciate your support!

Donors in the United States
=============================

In order to save fees, please use one of the links below. If you use a credit in your account or your bank account is linked to the service, there are no fees. Choose the "friends and family" option. But if you use a credit card, they will charge us a fee and a percentage. So credit card donations should be more than $2 in order to be practical.
