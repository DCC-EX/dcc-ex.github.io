Command Station Downloads
=========================

Welcome to the Command Station download page. You have several choices: 

* **[RECOMMENDED]** If you are a Conductor, or you just want an easy installer to do the work for you, go to the :ref:`exInstaller` section. 
* If are a Tinkerer or you would like to downlad a zip file and install the firmware using the Arduino IDE, go to the :ref:`Latest DCC++ EX Release` section. 
* If you are an Engineer or developer and want to clone the repository onto your computer, go to the :ref:`CommandStation-EX Repository` section.
* If you're looking for BaseStation-Classic, go to the :ref:`Getting BaseStation-Classic` section.

exInstaller
-------------------------

.. note:: After downloading the latest version of the installer from the release page for your operating system and installing the software, you will have the opportunity to select either CommandStation-EX or BaseStation-Classic. The installer will let you select options, such as your Arduino type and motor shield type, then automatically compile the firmware and upload it to your Arduino or compatible board.

Latest DCC++ EX Release
-----------------------

.. note:: On the releases page, select the most recent version and download the .zip file. The zip file contains the Arduino Sketch file for DCC++ EX. You will need either the Arduino IDE or the PlatformIO development environment in order to upload it to your microcontroller board.

CommandStation-EX Repository
----------------------------

.. note:: The link below will take you the the CommandStation-EX GitHub repository, where you can clone the project to your computer. We have made sure that you can still use the Arduino IDE if you like, but we recommend devlopers use the PlaformIO development environment. See the `Contributing Page <../contributing/index.html>`_ for more information.
