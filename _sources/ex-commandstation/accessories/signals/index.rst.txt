Signals
*******

Adding signals to your layout can add an extra level of realism and interest, and can also be used in a practical sense for operators if reflected on mimic panels to indicate when trains can proceed.

|EX-CS| can control semaphore signals via servos and light (red, amber, green) signals with one, two, or three aspects. DCC accessory signals can also be controlled.

This section will focus on the types of signals supported by |EX-CS| with the common hardware configurations required to support them.
