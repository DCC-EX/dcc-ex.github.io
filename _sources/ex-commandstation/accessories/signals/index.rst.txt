Signals
*******

Adding signals to your layout can add an extra level of realism and interest, and of course can be used in a practical sense if reflected on mimic panels to indicate when trains can proceed.

|EX-CS| can control semaphore signals via servos and light (red, amber, green) signals with one, two, or three aspects.

This section will focus on the types of signals supported by |EX-CS| with the common hardware configurations required to support them.
