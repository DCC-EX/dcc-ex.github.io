Installation Options

|tinkerer| |engineer|

There are two options available to install |EX-CS|:

* |EX-I| is aimed at the |conductor-text| level user utilising the recommended hardware, and is the simplest option to get |EX-CS| installed and running
* The Arduino IDE is more aimed at the |tinkerer-text| or |engineer-text| level user who is using different hardware options or requires a level of customisation not available in |EX-I|
