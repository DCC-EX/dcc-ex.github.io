Connection type: Bluetooth
==========================

If you wish to connect to your |EX-CS| wirelessly but only need a single connection, you can use Bluetooth connectivity. This also allows |JMRi| to connect providing the computer or Raspberry Pi running |JMRi| can pair with a Bluetooth device and present that device as a serial port.

For details on the options available for using Bluetooth, refer to the :doc:`/reference/hardware/bluetooth` section.
