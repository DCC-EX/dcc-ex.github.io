Supported WiFi Shields and Boards

The following pages describe all the supported WiFi options of the |EX-CS|.  If you identify as a |conductor-text| and have installed only the recommended hardware we suggest that you look at the guide on the :doc:`/ex-commandstation/get-started/wifi-setup` page.

    :class: warning-float-right

   Please be aware that the Espressif firmware shipped with these devices **may not work** with |EX-CS| will probably NOT work with |EX-CS| out of the box.

   This can be corrected but is probably beyond Conductor level and requires additional hardware.  

   See :doc:`/support/wifi-at-version` for details on how to check the version and how to correct it if needed.

   We are currently investigating other options.
