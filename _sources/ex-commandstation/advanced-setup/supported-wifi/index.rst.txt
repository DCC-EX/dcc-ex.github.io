*********************************
Supported WiFi Shields and Boards
*********************************

|tinkerer| |engineer|

The following pages describe all the supported WiFi options of the |EX-CS|.  If you identify as a |conductor-text| and have installed only the recommended hardware we suggest that you look at the guide on the :doc:`/ex-commandstation/get-started/wifi-setup` page.

.. warning:: 

    Please be aware that the Espressif firmware provided with your device **may not immediately work** with |EX-CS| as there are many different versions which behave quite differently.

    We highly recommend upgrading or downgrading to the "NonOS AT" version 1.7.4 available on our :doc:`/download/esp8266` download page prior to reaching out for support from the team.
