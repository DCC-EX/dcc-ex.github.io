   EX-Installer - Configure Motor Driver

You *must* select the motor driver type that you have installed.  The installer can't detect this, so you must select the correct board or the |EX-CS| may not work. If you have installed the recommended Motor Driver, select `STANDARD_MOTOR_SHIELD` if you purchased the **Arduino Motor Shield Rev3**, or `EX8874_SHIELD` if you purchased our **EX-MotorShield8874**.

.. sidebar:: Station Mode VS Access Point Mode

   |conductor| |BR| There is no right or wrong selection here. Both options here may be valid for you to use, depending on how you wish to use your |EX-CS|.

   If a) your layout is close to your home WiFi network, b) you don't transport the layout around, c) you need to use more than four WiFi controllers at a time, and/or d) you are not likely to, or have no concerns about letting visitors access your home WiFi (for them to use their own devices on your layout), then **Station Mode** is probably a better option.

   If the above is not generally true, then **Access Point Mode** may be a better choice.

   You must choose one of these options now, but you can always come back later and re-load the software with a different option.

**WiFi**

If you have installed and optional WiFi board, or are using a microcontroller board with integrated WiFi, enable the ``I have WiFi`` option, which will present you with additional options.

You can configure the WiFi for EX-CommandStation two ways:

* **Access Point mode** |BR| You can configure for EX-CommandStation to have its own, completely isolated, WiFi Network. This is referred to as *Access Point Mode*. (Most useful if your layout is away from the house, or you transport your layout frequently.) |BR| To enable, select ``Use my EX-CommandStation as an Access Point`` 
* **Station mode**  |BR| The EX-CommandStation can be setup so that it connects to your existing home WiFi Network. This is referred to as *Station Mode*. |BR| To enable, select  ``Connect my EX-CommandStation to my existing wireless network`` 

**Use my EX-CommandStation as an Access Point**

      EX-Installer - Configure WiFi - Access Point

   .. note::
      :class: note-float-right

      If possible, choose a channel that is unused (or least used) by other WiFi networks around your location. |BR|      
      There are numerous phone apps that can help you determine which channels are being used by other networks. For Android, *'Wifi Analyzer'* is one that works.  For iOS *'Netspot'* is suitable :dcc-ex-text-size-60pct:`(you don't need to purchase WiPry device they mention)`.
   

   If ``Use my EX-CommandStation as an Access Point`` is selected, two additional options are presented:

   * WiFi Password
   * WiFi Channel

   **WiFi Password** is optional.  |BR| **We recommend you leave this field blank.** |BR| If this field is left blank the password will default to "PASS_xxxxx" where 'xxxxx' will be the same as the SSID *name* that will be automatically configured.

   **WiFi Channel** can be any value from 1-11.

**Connect my EX-CommandStation to my existing wireless network**

      EX-Installer - Configure Wifi - Station Mode

   If ``Connect my EX-CommandStation to my existing wireless network`` is selected, two additional options are presented:

   * Wifi SSID
   * WiFi Password

   Both are required, Though it is possible, but unlikely, that the WiFi Password for your network is blank.  If so, leave the field blank.

   *WiFi SSID* is the name of your home network.

   *WiFi Password* is the password for your home network.

To proceed, click the :guilabel:`Compile and Load` button.
