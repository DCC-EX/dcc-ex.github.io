Welcome to the home of |EX-FC|, a fully integrated Fast Clock for |EX-CS|. 

|EX-FC| is a standalone adjustable speed clock built using an additional Arduino Uno microcontroller and a plug-in shield type TFT touch screen.  The commands built into the DCC_EX Command Station make it possible to also integrate an existing microcontroller based fast clock.
