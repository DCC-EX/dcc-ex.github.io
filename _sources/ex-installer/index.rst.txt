.. warning:: 

  Please be advised that our installer currently does not work reliably on Linux or macOS which is a known issue.

  For Linux users we recommend using the Arduino IDE. You can find instructions on the :doc:`/ex-commandstation/advanced-setup/installation-options/arduino-ide` page.

  We hope to have a new version available soon.

This page describes all the feature and options of the |EX-I|.  If you identify as an a |conductor-text| and have installed only the recommended hardware we suggest that you look at the simplified instructions on the :doc:`/ex-commandstation/get-started/installer` page.

----

Once you have assembled your |EX-CS| hardware you need to load our software onto it make is usable.  

To make it as simple as possible we have created the |EX-I| app.
