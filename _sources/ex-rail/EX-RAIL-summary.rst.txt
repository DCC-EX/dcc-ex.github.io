Notes
======

- COMMANDS are case sensitive. i.e. they must be in uppercase. Text parameters you provide (aliases,  descriptions) are not
- *AUTOMATION*, *ROUTE*, and *SEQUENCE* use the same ID number space, so a ``FOLLOW(n)`` command can be used for any of them.
- Sensors and outputs used by AT/AFTER/SET/RESET/LATCH/UNLATCH/SERVO/IF/IFNOT refer directly to Arduino pins, and those handled by |I2C| expansion.
- Signals also refer directly to pins, and the signal ID (for RED/AMBER/GREEN) is always the same as the RED signal pin.
- It's OK to use sensor IDs that have no physical item in the layout. These can only be LATCHed, tested (IF/IFNOT), or UNLATCHed in the scripts. If a sensor is latched by the script, it can only be unlatched by the scriptâ€¦ so ``AT(35) LATCH(35)`` for example, effectively latches sensor 35 on when detected once. Only sensors with ID's 0 to 255 may be LATCHED/UNLATCHED in your script.
- All IDs used in commands and functions will be numbers, or an ALIAS name if configured.
- Most IDs simply need to be unique, however RESERVE/FREE and LATCH/UNLATCH must be in the range 0 - 255.

.. note:: 

  There are four uses of ID numbers in EX-RAIL:

  - AUTOMATION, ROUTE, and SEQUENCE IDs
  - Turnout IDs
  - Pin IDs - Includes physical pins on the CommandStation, virtual pins (Vpins) on I/O extender modules, and virtual pins that have no physical presence
  - Virtual block IDs as used in RESERVE/FREE

  Therefore, you can have an AUTOMATION, a turnout, a Vpin, and a virtual block all defined with the same ID without issue as these will not relate to each other. This is probably a great reason to consider aliases to avoid confusion.

Conventions used on this page
=============================

- CAPITALISED words - These are EX-RAIL commands and are case sensitive
- lowercase words within () - These are EX-RAIL parameters that must be provided, with multiple parameters separated by a comma ",", for example SEQUENCE(id) or DELAYRANDOM(min_delay, max_delay)
- Quoted "text" - Text within quote marks "" are used as descriptions, and must include the quote characters, for example ROUTE(id, "description") becomes ROUTE(1, "This is the route description")
- Square brackets [] - Parameters within square brackets [] are optional and may be ommitted. If specifying these parameters, do not include the square brackets themselves, for example ALIAS(name[, value]) becomes ALIAS(MY_ALIAS) or ALIAS(MY_ALIAS, 3)
- \| - Use of the \| character means you need to provide one of the provided options only, for example ``<D POWER ON|OFF>`` becomes either ``<D POWER ON>`` or ``<D POWER OFF>``
