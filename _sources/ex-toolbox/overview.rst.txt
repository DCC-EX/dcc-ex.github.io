EX-Toolbox - Overview
*********************

|tinkerer|

|EX-TB| is a free, open source, Android app to help setup and configure your |EX-CS|. It is intended for setup, configuration, debugging you Command Station rather than continuous use.

It is designed to function if your |EX-CS| is configured with WiFi (either Access Point mode or Station mode) or Ethernet. It can't connect to a |EX-CS| though JMRI.  

It can't normally connect to a |EX-CS| though USB, however there some options that can allow this to work partly.  See :ref:`ex-toolbox/using:connecting via usb` for details.
