Installing
==========

|EX-TB| can be installed on your phone or tablet via the `Google Play Store <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dcc_ex.ex_toolbox>`_ .

Open the *Play Store* app on your phone or tablet and search for "EX-Toolbox".

Once installed, open |EX-TB| and it will go through the initial setup wizard where it will ask for one permission, and for which which theme you would like to use.

After you complete the setup wizard, you will be shown the 'Connection' Screen.

   EX-Toolbox Connecting

Other than the very first time you start |EX-TB|, when the app opens you will be shown the 'Connection' screen.

On the 'Connection' screen there are three ways you can select a |EX-CS| to connect to:

  - IP Address and Port
  - Discovered Servers
  - Recent servers

Discovered Servers
------------------

  This is the most common way to connect. If the server you want to connect to is in the list, simply click on it and you will be taken to the 'CV-Programming' screen.

  If the server does not appear in the recent list try one of the other two methods.  Your server not appearing in the recent list is not necessarily a problem and there can be a number of reasons why.

Recent Server List
------------------

  If the server you want to connect to is in the list, simply click on it and you will be taken to the 'CV-Programming' screen.

  A server being in this list *does not* necessarily mean that you will be able to connect it *now*. It just means that you have successfully connected to it in the past.


IP Address and Port
-------------------

  Type in the **IP address** and **Port** of the |EX-CS| and press :guilabel:`Connect`.

  To find your EX-CommandStation's IP address and Port refer you original setup or, if you have a OLED screen on your command station the details will be displayed on it.

  If you only ever connect to one |EX-CS| you can effectively bypass this screen by setting the 'Auto-Connect to WiThrottle Server?' preference.

DCC Decoder CV programming is available:

* on the Programming track (PROG) - Service Mode
* on the main line (MAIN) - Operation mode / Ops Mode

By default |EX-TB| shows the Service Mode options.  To switch to Operation Mode, select "Program on Main (Operation Mode)" on the drop down list at the top of the screen.

CV Programming (Service Mode)
-----------------------------

.. figure:: /_static/images/ex-toolbox/cv_programmer.png

   :align: right

   EX-Toolbox Connecting

Service Mode CV Programing is available form the 'CV Programming' screen, when 'Programming Track (ServiceMode)' is selected in the drop down list at the top of the screen.

Service Mode CV Programming allows you to both *Read* (if the decoder/loco supports it) and *Write* CVs.

You do not need to know the DCC Address of the decoder being changed, as all decoders/locos currently on the programming track will have the CV changed at the same time.

On this screen you can:

* read the decoder's DCC Address
* write a new DCC Address to the decoder
* read a CV value from the decoder
* write a CV value to the decoder
* select from a list of named, common CVs
* issue <> commands to the |EX-CS|

To read the DCC Address of the decoder click the :guilabel:`Read` button on the DCC Address row.

To write a DCC Address to the decoder, enter the address and click the :guilabel:`Write` button on the DCC Address row.

To read a CV of the decoder, enter the CV number and click the :guilabel:`Read` button on the CV row.

To write a CV value to the decoder, enter the CV number,  enter the value and click the :guilabel:`Write` button on the CV row.

If you select a 'common CV value' it will enter the CV number into the field. From there follow the instructions above for reading or writing the CV.

Note: Issuing a read or write will automatically turn the track power on.

See below for issuing DCC-EX commands.

   :alt: CV Programming (Operation Mode) 
   :scale: 50%
   :align: right

   EX-Toolbox CV Programming (Operation Mode) 

Operation Mode CV Programing is available form the 'CV Programming' screen, when 'Program on Main (Operation Mode)' is selected in the drop down list at the top of the screen.

Operation Mode CV Programming ONLY allows you to *Write* CVs.

To use Operation Mode CV Programming **you must know the DCC Address** of the decoder/loco you want to change.  Note: you should never try to change the DCC Address of the decoder/loco using Operation Mode CV Programming.

On this screen you can:

* write a new DCC Address to the decoder
* write a CV value to the decoder
* select from a list of named, common CVs
* issue <> commands to the |EX-CS|

To write a CV value to the decoder, enter the DCC Address of the decoder, enter the CV number,  enter the value and click the :guilabel:`Write` button on the CV row.

If you select a 'common CV value' it will enter the CV number into the field. From there follow the instructions above for writing the CV.

Note: Issuing a read or write will automatically turn the track power on.

See below for issuing DCC-EX commands.

----


Issuing <> Commands to the EX-CommandStation
--------------------------------------------

On several of the screens in |EX-TB| you can issue native DCC-EX ``<>`` commands to your |EX-CS|.

Enter the command you want to send, and click :guilabel:`Send`.

The command you send, and any responses from the command station will be shown below.

If you select a 'common command value' it will enter the command the field. From there follow the instructions above for issuing the command.

You can use the :guilabel:`Next` and :guilabel:`Prior` buttons to retrieve previously issues commands.

Each channel can be one of:

* ``DCC PROG`` - Programming Track
* ``DCC MAIN`` - Main Track
* ``DC``
* ``DC reversed polarity (DCX)``
* ``OFF``

Select the value you want for the channels and click :guilabel:`Set`

Note. If you select ``DC`` or ``DCX`` you must select a DCC address for the channel before pressing ``Set``.  What ever address you select, selecting that address on your throttle (e.g. Engine Driver) will result in  the DC locomotive on the track connected to that channel to respond.

Note. Only one channel can be ``PROG``. If you select more that one, one will turned ``OFF``.

**Turning Track Power On**

There are two ways to turn the Track Power on/off:

* Power Screen - accessed from the menu
* Power Action Bar button - needs to be enable in the preferences
 
The *Power Screen* can be accessed from the :menuselection:`Menu --> Power`.  This will open the Power Screen where there is a simple button that to turn the power on or off. Use the :guilabel:`Close` button or Android's :guilabel:`Back` button to return to the CV-Programming Screen.

If the *Power Action Bar button* is enabled, simply click on it to turn track power on or off.

.. note:: 

  You can also optionally enable the Power Button on the Action bar in the preferences.


Preferences
-----------

Most configuration options are found in the *Preferences* which is accessed via the overflow menu which is normally three dots (⁞) or three bars (≡).


View log
--------


Accessed from any of the main screens via :menuselection:`Menu --> View Log`.

This screen allows you to view the internal Engine Driver log of events.
This is sometimes useful for analysing problems.

The option to `Start recording to file` creates a user-accessible file that can be sent to the |EX-TB| app developers to assist you in resolving a problem.
The file will be located on your mobile phone at:
Internal storage ``/Android/data/dcc_ex.toolbox/files`` |br|\ and will be named something like: ``logcat9999999999999.txt``

Enable the preference to include the timestamp on each line of the log.


About
-----

This screen displays 

* Information about |EX-TB| 
* Information about the |EX-CS| it is currently connected to (if any)
* A page of basic information about |EX-CS|

----

Connecting via USB
==================

|EX-TB| can't normally connect to an |EX-CS| via USB, however it is possible to temporarily create a USB to IP connection on you PC using tools like *socat* or *SerialToIPGUI* (for windows).

Using *socat* in Linux:

   ``socat TCP4-LISTEN:2560 /dev/ttyUSB0,b115200,raw,echo=0``

   or (to provide more information)

   ``socat -d -d -d TCP4-LISTEN:2560 /dev/ttyUSB0,b115200,raw,echo=0``

   Note: Change 'dev/ttyUSB0' to the appropriate USB port that the command station is connected to.

Using *socat* in Microsoft Windows:

   ``socat TCP-LISTEN:2560 /dev/ttyS11,b115200,raw,echo=0``

   or (to provide more information)

   ``socat -d -d -d TCP-LISTEN:2560 /dev/ttyS11,b115200,raw,echo=0``


   Note: Change S11 to the appropriate USB port.  Whatever 'COM' number appears in the Device Manager, subtract 1.  |BR|
   i.e. 'COM12' in the Windows Device Manager becomes '/dev/ttyS11'


Using *SerialToIPGUI* (For Microsoft Windows) (Recommended):

   .. figure:: /_static/images/SerialToIPGUI/SerialToIPGUI.png
      :alt: SerialToIPGUI
      :scale: 50%
      :class: responsive-image

      SerialToIPGUI

   * start SerialToIPGUI
   * Select the correct COM port for the command station
   * Enter the port of '2560' 
   * Click :guilabel:`Start`

   Once started...
   
   * Open |EX-TB| on your Android device
   * Enter the IP address of your PC (The one running socat or SerialToIPGUI)
   * Enter the port of '2560' 
   * Click :guilabel:`connect`

.. warning::

   This 'trick' only supports a single connection at a time.  So it is important that JMRI (if you are using it), or the Arduino IDE serial monitor, or anything else that might be using the COM (USB) port are shut down first.

Downloads
---------

 * *SerialToIPGUI*  - https://sourceforge.net/projects/serialtoip/
 * *socat* for windows requires downloading the 'cgywin' and installing the optional 'socat' package when you install - https://www.cygwin.com/ 

Troubleshooting (Windows)
=========================

In Microsoft Windows, if you see a "command not found" error, Here is what you need to do to fix it:

* Right click on "My Computer" -> Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables
* Add a new environment variable, called ``CYGWIN_HOME`` and set its value to ``C:\cygwin``
* Edit the PATH environment variable and add ``C:\cygwin\bin`` to it (usually separated by a ';').
* Just click okay, exit any command prompts or bash shells (over cygwin) you may have open, and open it again - it'll work!

Note that if you installed cgywin to a folder *other than "C:\\cgywin"* (e.g. c:\\cgywin64), use that folder name instead in the change above.
