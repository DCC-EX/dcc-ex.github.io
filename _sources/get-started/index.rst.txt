Get Started
===========

This page is intended to get you started with DCC++ by building your hardware setup, installing software, flashing firmware, and running your first train. After that, examples will be given for how the base system can be extended and upgraded.

What you need
-------------

**Hardware**:

- Supported `Arduino board <../reference/hardware/microcontroller-boards.html>`_
- Supported `motor shield <../reference/hardware/motor-boards.html>`_
- Compatible `power supply <../reference/hardware/power-supplies.html>`_
- USB cable
- Computer running Windows, Linux, or macOS (or a Raspberry Pi)
- Piece of track to run trains or program on
- Known-working DCC-equipped locomotive

**Optional hardware**:

- Supported `ESP8266 WiFi shield <../reference/hardware/wifi-boards.html>`_
- Supported `Ethernet shield <../reference/hardware/ethernet-boards.html>`_

**Software**:

- See the `Command Station download page <../download/commandstation.html>`_

The DCC++ EX installer is recommended for most users and automatically downloads and installs the required software. 

You'll also need something to control your trains. Because there's several options, we will discuss this following setup of the system.
