  `Version 4.1.2 Released <about/press/v412-announce.html>`_

|DCC-EX| is a team of dedicated enthusiasts producing open source *DCC solutions* for you to run your complete model railroad layout. Our easy to use, do-it-yourself, and free open source products run on off-the-shelf Arduino technology and are supported by numerous third party hardware and apps like |JMRI|, |Engine Driver|, |WiThrottle|, Rocrail and more.

If you are just starting your journey with |DCC-EX| then the sections below are designed to help you understand how our products might suit your needs. We've curated this guidance based on feedback from our users:
