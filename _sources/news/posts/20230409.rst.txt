Final Version 4 Release (v4.1.5)
================================

We're excited to announce the final version 4 release of |EX-CS| before we move to version 5!

This is just a minor bugfix release from the previous version 4.1.2. This release is a Bugfix release to fix the initialisation order to benefit Ethernet boards, to fix GitHub issue `#299 <https://github.com/DCC-EX/CommandStation-EX/issues/299>`_ related to TurnoutDescription, and to fix command parsing for LCN (the Layout Control Nodes Accessory Network).

There is also an updated :ref:`reference/downloads/documents:comprehensive dcc-ex & jmri decoderpro getting started guide pdf` available for download to help you get up and running with |JMRi| DecoderPro and |DCC-EX|.

**Look for some major new features soon in version 5.0!**
