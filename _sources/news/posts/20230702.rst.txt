DCC-EX has a new installer!
===========================

Yes, that's right, the |DCC-EX| team is announcing we have an updated |EX-I|!

The previous version has been a welcome addition to the family and served many users well, however only caters for |EX-CS|, and has recently had issues for our Linux and macOS users, meaning it was time for a refresh.

Our new installer has been written in Python with a view to being portable across as many operating systems as possible and continues to use the Arduino Command Line Interface (CLI) in the background to manage loading the |DCC-EX| software onto your Arduino device.

Further to this, the new |EX-I| has been written in a way that will allow you to install our other Arduino based products with it in the future, including |EX-IO|, |EX-TT|, |EX-FC|, and |EX-DCCI|.

You just need to download one file for either Windows, Linux, or macOS in order to get up and running with the new |EX-I|, and it will take care of downloading our software and managing your Arduino device. [1]_

For instructions on how to get the new |EX-I| and how to use it, head over to the :doc:`/ex-installer/index` page.

.. [1] For Windows users with generic or clone Arduino devices, you will still need to install suitable USB to serial drivers (eg. CH340/341) as the Arduino CLI only provides drivers for genuine Arduino devices.
