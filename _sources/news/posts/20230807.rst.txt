Version 5 is here!
==================

|NEW-IN-V5| Yep, that's right, the much anticipated |EX-CS| version 5 release is here at last! This is a huge release, adding significant new features like |TM|, enhancing existing capabilities, introducting new and enhanced I/O support, along with other associated products such as |EX-FC|, |EX-TT|, and |EX-IO|.

We highly recommend upgrading to version 5 to take advantage of the improvements we've made, and especially for those users who are using our new |EX-MS|, as we've improved how it deals with overloads and inrush current amongst other enhancements.

To get your hands on this latest release, select ``Latest Production`` when running |EX-I| (see :ref:`ex-installer/installing:download and run ex-installer`), or you can download it manually by following the directions in :ref:`download/ex-commandstation:latest ex-commandstation official release`.

We've outlined the key updates below but this is not an exhaustive list.

EX-CommandStation features, fixes, and enhancements
---------------------------------------------------

- |TM| - Run both DC and DCC trains from the same controller and switch your tracks between DC and DCC modes live, see :doc:`/trackmanager/index`
- Beta support for new, 32 bit microcontrollers including ESP32 WROOM and some STMicroelectronics Nucleo, see :doc:`/reference/hardware/microcontrollers/microcontrollers`
- Extensive optimisation of HIGHMEM useage to free up PROGMEM below the 64kb and increase the useful life of the AVR Mega2560 platform
- Add option to disable programming to allow limited platforms such as the Arduino Uno to run limited |EX-R| scripts
- Add support for our new fast clock |EX-FC|, see :doc:`/ex-fastclock/index`
- Add support for our new I/O expander |EX-IO|, see :doc:`/ex-ioexpander/index`
- Add support for our new turntable controller |EX-TT|, see :doc:`/ex-turntable/index`
- Add support for duinoNodes, see :doc:`/ex-commandstation/accessories/inputs-outputs/duinonodes`
- Add support for a rotary encoder, see :ref:`ex-turntable/test-and-tune:controlling ex-turntable with a rotary encoder`
- Add support for PCF8575 and PCA/TCA9555 GPIO devices
- Enhanced overcurrent detection, including enhancing the behaviour to deal with inrush current issues
- Moved startup of the HAL earlier in the boot sequence
- Improved performance for ADC (analogue to digital) reads
- Enhancements to |I2C| bus retries and timeouts
- Support for |I2C| multiplexers to help with devices with static or limited address ranges
- Support for multiple |I2C| displays
- Improved handling of conflicting |I2C| addresses and Vpin allocations
- Enhanced DFPlayer error handling
- Add ``<JG>`` and ``<JI>`` for multi-track gauges to support |TM|
- Improved stability for the VL53L0X ToF sensor
- Bugfix for signals being inverted (active high was actually active low and vice versa)
- Bugfix for Ethernet allowing a static IP address to be set

Known Issues
------------

- We have one known issue in version 5 where DFPlayer doesn't work correctly in some circumstances, which we are investigating and will fix soon

EXRAIL enhancements
-------------------

For details on these changes and new commands, refer to our new, consolidated :doc:`/ex-rail/EX-RAIL-command-reference`.

- **BREAKING CHANGE** Removed implicit ``AUTOSTART`` from myAutomation.h, simply add ``AUTOSTART`` to the beginning of the file to restore this, see :ref:`ex-rail/ex-rail-command-reference:scripts/sequences - types and control`
- Enhance ``SPEED`` command to respond to external direction changes
- Add ``DCC_SIGNAL`` command to control DCC Accessory based signals
- Add ``VIRTUAL_SIGNAL`` command to enable user-defined signal sequences
- Add ``ONGREEN``, ``ONAMBER``, and ``ONRED`` signal event handlers to respond to signal changes
- Add ``TURNOUTL`` command to enable using a linear DCC address for DCC Accessory turnouts
- Add ``MOVETT`` command to enable controlling an |EX-TT|
- Add ``IFRE`` command to test the position of a rotary encoder
- Add ``ONCHANGE`` event handler to respond to a position change of a rotary encoder
- Add ``ONCLOCKTIME`` and ``ONCLOCKMINS`` event handlers to respond to |EX-FC| times
- Add ``IFLOCO`` command to test if the provided loco ID is used in the sequence
- Add ``FORGET`` command to drop the provided loco ID from reminder tables
- Add ``SET_TRACK`` command to configure |TM| in sequences
- Add ``SERIAL4``, ``SERIAL5``, and ``SERIAL6`` to support newer microcontrollers with more/different interfaces
- Add ``SCREEN`` command to display messages on multiple displays
- Add ``POWERON`` and ``POWEROFF`` commands to control track power

Website enhancements
--------------------

As always, we are continuing to ensure our website is updated, and endeavour to make it easier to use and find information.
