Farewell to the old exInstaller, in with the new EX-Installer!
==============================================================

Today, we bid a fond farewell to the old exInstaller, used successfully by many a user to load our flagship product |EX-CS| onto Arduino devices around the world and enable DCC control of many model railroading layouts.

As announced earlier this year, our new |EX-I| has been released to supersede our original installer, and over time will allow loading all our Arduino based products rather than just focusing on |EX-CS|.

If you still use the original exInstaller, we encourage you to move to :doc:`/ex-installer/index` instead.

The old exInstaller has now been made a public archive, and no further development will occur.
