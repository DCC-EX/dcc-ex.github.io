Stationary Decoder Address Table
*********************************

Click on this link to download an Excel Spreadsheet (.xlsx file) that provides a table for looking up and converting DCC++ 2 part (address/subaddress) decoder addresses to 1 part linear addresses and back. Note that JMRI automatically converts linear addresses to 2 part addresses internally, but you may need to know 2-part addresses to save things like turnouts in the DCC-EX Command Station. This is based on the work of Tom Busza.
