You can connect a Bluetooth module to a spare serial port on your |EX-CS| to enable Bluetooth connectivity from a single throttle or controller including smartphone apps such as |Engine Driver| or |WiThrottle|.

If you require multiple throttles or controllers connected simultaneously, you will need to have WiFi or Ethernet connectivity instead.

Refer to the following pages for the various supported Bluetooth options available.
