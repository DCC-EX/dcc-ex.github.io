Current list of Microcontrollers
================================

|EX-CS| currently is designed for Atmel AVR based Arduino and compatible microcontrollers, and some ARM based boards such as the Teensy range. Out of the box, it is compatible with the following boards:

Will you support other microcontrollers in the future?
=======================================================

Yes, that is on our :doc:`roadmap </about/roadmap>`, and the current state of progress can be found in our :doc:`features under development </under-development/index>` area. New microcontrollers being ported to include ESP32, SAMD21, and the STM32F4xx range as can be seen in :doc:`under development microcontrollers</under-development/microcontrollers>`.

Boards that will NOT work
==========================

**WAVGAT Uno clone** - This board is NOT 100% Uno compatible. It uses a LGT8F328P processor from a company in China called "Logic Green". It has no EEPROM and requires a bit of configuration in the Arduino IDE to get it to be seen correctly and compile sketches. It is, however, a good board for developing other applications on because it can be switched to run at 32mHz instead of 16. It also has 12 bit analog pins instead of 10 bit. That means higher resolution readings, 0-4096 instead of 0-1024. It could potentially work as a Command Station with more testing and some code changes, but we will leave that to someone else to attempt. Various other microcontrollers offer more memory, more serial ports and more GPIO pins and are just a better way to go for the future.
