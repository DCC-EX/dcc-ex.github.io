Deek-Robot Motor Shield
***********************

|conductor|

.. note:: 

   This board is compatible with |TM| DC mode.

Electrically identical in most every regard to the Arduino motor shield. Often cheaper. Supports 2A per channel, but can deliver realistically 1.3 or maybe 1.5 Amps with an added heatsink and cooling fan.
