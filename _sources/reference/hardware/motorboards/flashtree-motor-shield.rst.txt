Flashtree Motor Shield
**************************

|conductor|

Electrically identical in most every regard to the Arduino motor shield. Often cheaper. Supports 2A per channel, but can deliver realistically 1.3 or maybe 1.5 Amps with an added heatsink and cooling fan. Since it identical to the Arduino and the Deek-Robot boards, use the Deek-Robot install below.
