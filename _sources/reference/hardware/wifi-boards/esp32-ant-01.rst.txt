Like the SparkFun board, this board is a very powerful board in its own right. It almost seems a shame to use it just for WiFi, though with custom firmware, it could handle WiFi duty and a lot more. The advantage of this board is it has a connector for an external antenna. It is half the price of the SparkFun board and comes with an antenna.
