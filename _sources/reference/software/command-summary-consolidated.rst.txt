**This is a summary, for a detailed command, see...**
  :doc:`Command Reference <command-reference>`

This page describes all the |DCC-EX Native commands| that the |EX-CS| supports.

Conventions used on this page
=============================

- ``<`` and ``>`` - All DCC-EX commands are surrounded by these characters to indicate the beginning and end, these must always be included
- First letter or number - These are called OPCODES, are case sensitive, and must be specified as directed, eg. ``1``, ``c``, or ``-``
- CAPITALISED words - These are parameters referred to as keywords, and should be specified as directed, eg. ``MAIN`` (note these are not case sensitive, however capitalising makes them easier to distinguish from other parameters)
- lowercase words - These are parameters that must be provided or are returned, with multiple parameters separated by a space " ", eg. ``cab``
- Square brackets ``[]`` - Parameters within square brackets ``[]`` are optional and may be omitted, and if specifying these parameters, do not include the square brackets themselves
- \| - Use of the \| character means you need to provide one of the provided options only, for example ``<0|1 MAIN|PROG|JOIN>`` becomes either ``<0 MAIN>`` or ``<1 MAIN>``
- ``0|1`` DIRECTION: 1=forward, 0=reverse.

Controlling the EX-CommandStation
=================================

Power management

|hr-dashed|

``<D RESET>`` - **Re-boot the command Station**

  *Parameters:* N/A |BR|
  *Response:* N/A

``<J I>`` ``<JI>`` - **Request current status**

  *Parameters:* N/A

  *Response:* Repeated for each Channel/Track: ``<j I track current>`` |BR|
  |_| > **track:**  channel/track |BR|
  |_| > **current:** current in milliamps
    
    *Version Introduced: 4.2.19* 

|hr-dashed|

``<J G>`` ``<JG>`` - **Request max current** |BR|

  *Parameters:*  N/A
  
  *Response:* |BR|
  |_| repeated for each Channel/Track: ``<j G track currentmax>`` |BR|
  |_| > **track:**  channel/track |BR|
  |_| > **currentmax:** current in milliamps
    
    *Version Introduced: 4.2.19*

|hr-dashed|

``<onOff [track]>`` - **Turns power on and off to the MAIN and PROG tracks together or independently. Also allows joining the MAIN and PROG tracks together.**

  *Parameters:* |BR|
  |_| > **onOff:** one of |BR|
  |_|  |_| - 1 = on |BR|
  |_|  |_| - 0 = off |BR|
  |_| > **track:** one of |BR|
  |_|  |_| - blank = Both Main and Programming Tracks  |BR|
  |_|  |_| - MAIN = Main track  |BR|
  |_|  |_| - PROG = Programming Track  |BR|
  |_|  |_| - JOIN = Join the Main and Programming tracks temporarily |BR|
  |_|  |BR|
  |_| e.g. |BR|
  |_| all tracks off: ``<0>`` |BR|
  |_| all tracks on ``<1>`` |BR|
  |_| join: ``<1 JOIN>`` |BR|
    
  *Response:*  N/A

  *Notes:*

  The use of the JOIN function ensures that the DCC signal for the MAIN track is also sent to the PROG track. This allows the prog track to act as a siding (or similar) in the main layout even though it is isolated electrically and connected to the programming track output. However, it is important that the prog track wiring be in the same phase as the main track i.e. when the left rail is high on MAIN, it is also high on PROG. You may have to swap the wires to your prog track to make this work. If you drive onto a programming track that is "joined" and enter a programming command, the track will automatically switch to a programming track. If you use a compatible Throttle, you can then send the join command again and drive off the track onto the rest of your layout! |BR|
  In some split motor shield hardware configurations JOIN will not be able to work.

Cab (Loco) Commands
-------------------

|hr-dashed|

``<!>`` - **Emergency Stop**

  *Parameters:* N/A
  
  *Response:* |BR|
  |_| Repeated for each loco in the reminders list ``<l cab reg speedByte functMap>`` |BR|
  |_| Refer to the ``<t ..>`` commmand for details on this response.

|hr-dashed|

``<- [cab]>`` - **Remove one or all locos from reminders**

  *Parameters:* |BR|
  |_| > **cab:** one of |BR|
  |_|  |_| - blank = all locos  |BR|
  |_|  |_| - No. = Cab (loco) to forget
  
  *Response:* N/A
  
  *Notes:*
  
    Forgets one or all locos. The "cab" parameter is optional.  |BR|
    Once you send a throttle command to any loco, throttle commands to that loco will continue to be sent to the track. If you remove the loco, or for testing purposes need to clear the loco from repeating messages to the track, you can use this command. Sending **<- cab>** will forget/clear that loco. Sending **<->** will clear all the locos. This doesn't do anything destructive or erase any loco settings, it just clears the speed reminders from being sent to the track. As soon as a controller sends another throttle command, it will go back to repeating those commands.

  *Notes:*

    The *speedbyte* value is different to the *speed* sent, as it is an encoded (1,7 bits)  byte. |BR|
    This starts a reminder process for any external updates to the cab's (loco's) status.

|hr-dashed|

``<t cab speed dir>`` - **Set Cab (Loco) Speed**

  |_|  |BR|
  |_| ``<l cab reg speedByte functMap>`` |BR|
  |_| refer to the <t > command above for details
  
  *Notes:*

    Setting requests are transmitted directly to mobile loco decoder. |BR|
    Current state of loco functions (as known by commands issued since power on) is stored by the CommandStation - All functions within a group get set all at once per NMRA DCC standards. |BR|
    The command station knows about the previous settings in the same group and will not, for example, unset F2 because you change F1. If, however, you have never set F2, then changing F1 WILL unset F2. |BR|

  .. collapse::  Additional Information for byte1: (click to show)

      To make "byte1" add the values of what you want ON together, the ones that you want OFF do not get added to the base value of 128.

      * F0 (Light)=16, F1 (Bell)=1, F2 (Horn)=2, F3=4, F4=8
      * All off = 128
      * Light on 128 + 16 = 144
      * Light and bell on 128 + 16 + 1 = 145
      * Light and horn on 128 + 16 + 2 = 146
      * Just horn 128 + 2 = 130

      If light is on (144), Then you turn on bell with light (145), Bell back off but light on (144)

``<#>`` - **Requests the number of supported cabs(locos)**

  *Parameters:* N/A

  *Response:* |BR|
  |_| ``<# noCabs>`` |BR|
  |_| > **noCabs:** maximum number of Cabs(Locos) supported by the command station
  
  *Notes:*
  
    This will display the number of available cab slots. This will typically be **<# 20>**, **<# 30>**, or **<# 50>** depending on how much memory your EX‑CommandStation has available.  |BR| This is a design limit based on the memory limitations of the particular hardware and a compromise with other features that require memory such as WiFI. If you need more slots and are comfortable with code changes you can adjust this by changing MAX_LOCOS in "DCC.h", knowing that each new slot will take approximately 8 bytes of memory. The **<D RAM>** command will display the amount of free memory. If you fill the available slots, the "Forget Locos" command (**<- [CAB]>**) will free up unused locos. Currently there is no automatic purging of unused locos.

DCC Accessories
---------------

EX-CS| can keep track of the direction of any turnout that is controlled by a DCC stationary accessory decoder once its Defined (Set Up).

All decoders that are not in an engine are accessory decoders including turnouts.

Any DCC Accessory Decoder based turnouts, as well as any other DCC accessories connected in this fashion, can always be operated using the DCC COMMAND STATION Accessory command:

|hr-dashed|

There are two interchangeable commands for controlling Accessory Decoders, the Address/Subaddress method (aka “Dual-Coil” method) and linear addressing method. You can either specify an address and its subaddress (Addresses 0-511 with Subaddresses from 0-3) or the straight linear address (Addresses from 1-2044).

In the mapping used by EX-CS|, linear addresses range from linear address 1, which is address 1 subaddress 0, up to linear address 2040 which is address 510 subaddress 3. Decoder address 511 (linear addresses 2041-2044) is reserved for use as a broadcast address and should not be used for decoders. Decoder address 0 does not have a corresponding linear address. This seems strange, but it is the mapping used by many, but not all, commercial manufacturers. If your decoder does not respond on the expected linear address, try adding and subtracting 4 to see if it works. Or use the address/subaddress versions of the commands.

Here is a spreadsheet in .XLSX format to help you: :ref:`reference/downloads/documents:stationary decoder address table (xlsx spreadsheet)`.

NOTE: Both the following commands do the same thing. Pick the one that works for your needs.

  |_|  |_| - 0=off, deactivate, straight or Closed  |BR|
  |_|  |_| - 1=on, activate, turn or thrown

Configuring the EX-CommandStation
=================================

Configuring the EX-CommandStation - Turnouts/Points
---------------------------------------------------

The Turnout commands provide a more flexible and more functional way of operating turnouts. It requires that the turnout be pre-defined through the ``<T ...>`` commands, described below.

Turnouts may be in either of two states: Closed or Thrown. The turnout commands below use the values ``1`` for ``Throw`` or ``Thrown`` and ``0`` for ``Close`` or ``Closed``.

*General notes:*

**vpin:** is the pin number of the output to be controlled by the turnout/point object. For Arduino output pins, this is the same as the digital pin number. For servo outputs and I/O expanders, it is the pin number defined for the HAL device (if present), for example 100-115 for servos attached to the first PCA9685 Servo Controller module, 116-131 for the second PCA9685 module, 164-179 for pins on the first MCP23017 GPIO expander module, and 180-195 for the second MCP23017 module.

  *Response:* ???
  
  .. collapse:: Examples: (click to show)
    
      *Example:* ``<T 23 DCC 5 0>``

      *Example:* You have a turnout on your main line going to warehouse industry. The turnout is controlled by an accessory decoder with a address of 123 and is wired to output 3. You want it to have the ID of 10. You would send the following command to the CommandStation: ``<T 10 DCC 123 3>``

      This Command means:

        * **T** = (Upper case T) Define a Turnout
        * **DCC** = The turnout is DCC Accessory Decoder based
        * **10** = ID number I am setting to use this turnout
        * **123** = The accessory decoders address
        * **3** = The turnout is wired to output 3

      Next you would send the following command to the EX-CS: ``<E>``
      
      This Command means:

      * E : (Upper case E) Store (save) this definition to EEPROM

    The positions are the same as for the turnout/point servo command above. Note: Servos are not supported on the minimal HAL (Uno or Nano target).

|hr-dashed|
  
Once all turnouts have been properly defined, Use the ``<E>`` command to store their definitions to EEPROM. If you later make edits/additions/deletions to the turnout definitions, you must invoke the ``<E>`` command if you want those new definitions updated in the EEPROM. You can also ERASE everything; (turnouts, sensors, and outputs) stored in the EEPROM by invoking the ``<e>`` (lower case e) command. WARNING: (There is no Un-Delete)

If turnout definitions are stored in EEPROM, the turnout thrown/closed state is also written to EEPROM whenever the turnout is switched. Consequently, when the |EX-CS| is restarted the turnout outputs may be set to their last known state (applicable for Servo and VPIN turnouts). This is intended so that the servos don't perform a sweep on power-on when their physical position does not match initial position in the CommandStation.

----

Configuring the EX-CommandStation - Sensors
-------------------------------------------

|EX-CS| supports Sensor inputs that can be connected to any Arduino Pin not in use by this program, as well as pins on external I/O expanders and other devices. Physical sensors can be of any type (infrared, magnetic, mechanical…). They may be configured to pull-up or not. When configured for pull-up, the input is connected (within the CS) to +5V via a resistor. This sort of input is suited to sensors that have two wires (a switch or relay contacts, or a device with an 'open collector' or 'open drain' output. Some sensors may be sensitive to the pull-up resistor and not operate as expected - in this case you can turn off the pull-up.

The sensor is considered INACTIVE when at +5V potential, and ACTIVE when the pin is pulled down to 0V.

To ensure proper voltage levels, some part of the Sensor circuitry MUST be tied back to the same ground as used by the Arduino.

The Sensor code utilizes debouncing logic to eliminate contact ‘bounce’ generated by mechanical switches on transitions. This avoids the need to create smoothing circuitry for each sensor. You may need to change the parameters in Sensor.cpp through trial and error for your specific sensors, but the default parameters protect against contact bounces for up to 20 milliseconds, which should be adequate for almost all mechanical switches and all electronic sensors.

To have this sketch monitor one or more Arduino pins for sensor triggers, first define/edit/delete sensor definitions using the following variation of the ``<S>`` command:

|hr-dashed|

``<S id vpin pullup>`` - **Create a new sensor ID**

  *Parameters:* |BR|
  |_| > **id:** identifier of the Sensor (0-32767) |BR|
  |_| > **vpin:** vpin of the input to be controlled by the sensor object For Arduino input pins, this is the same as the digital pin number. For servo inputs and I/O expanders, it is the pin number defined for the HAL device (if present), for example 164-179 for pins on the first MCP23017 GPIO expander module, and 180-195 for the second MCP23017 module.|BR|
  |_| > **pullup:** one of  |BR|
  |_|  |_| - 1=Use pull-up resistor ACTIVE=LOW  |BR|
  |_|  |_| - 0=don't use pull-up resistor ACTIVE=HIGH
  
  *Response:* |BR|
  |_| Successful: **<O>** |BR|
  |_| Fail: ????
  
  *Notes:*
  
    Once defined, the EX-CS will send a ``<Q id>`` response anytime the sensor is activated, and a ``<q id>`` response when deactivated. 

|hr-dashed|

``<S id>`` - **Delete defined sensor**

  *Parameters:* |BR|
  |_| > **id:** identifier of the Sensor (0-32767)
  
  *Response:* |BR|
  |_| Successful: ``<O>`` |BR|
  |_| Fail: ``<X>``

|hr-dashed|

Once all sensors have been properly defined, use the ``<E>`` (upper case E) command to store their definitions to EEPROM. If you later make edits/additions/deletions to the sensor definitions, you must invoke the ``<E>`` (upper case E) command if you want those new definitions updated in the EEPROM. You can also clear everything (turnouts, sensors, and outputs) stored in the EEPROM by invoking the ``<e>`` (lower case e) command. (There is NO UN-Delete)

All sensors defined as per above are repeatedly and sequentially checked within the main loop of this sketch. If a Sensor Pin is found to have transitioned from one state to another, one of the following serial messages are generated:

* ``<Q id>`` - for transition of Sensor ID from INACTIVE state to ACTIVE state (i.e. the sensor is triggered)
* ``<q id>`` - for transition of Sensor ID from ACTIVE state to INACTIVE state (i.e. the sensor is no longer triggered)

Depending on whether the physical sensor is acting as an "event-trigger" or a "detection-sensor", you may decide to ignore the ``<q id>`` return and only react to ``<Q id>`` triggers.

Configuring the EX-CommandStation - Diagnostic programming commands
-------------------------------------------------------------------

|hr-dashed|

``<D PROGBOOST>`` - **Override 250mA prog track limit while idle**

  *Parameters:* N/A |BR|
  *Response:* N/A
  
  *Notes:*
  
    When the programming track is switched on with **<1>** or **<1 PROG>** it will normally be restricted to 250mA according to NMRA standards. Some loco decoders require more than this, especially sound versions. **<D PROGBOOST>** temporarily removes this limit to allow the decoder to use more power. The normal limit will be re-imposed when the programming track is switched off with **<0>** or **<0 PROG>** or the Command Station is reset.

|hr-dashed|

``<D ACK LIMIT mA>`` - **Sets the ACK limit**

  *Parameters:* |BR|
  |_| > **mA:** currently limit in milliamps

  *Response:* N/A

  *Notes:*
      
    The Ack current limit is set according to the DCC standard(s) of 60mA. Most decoders send a quick back and forth current pulse to the motor to generate this ACK. However, some modern motors (N and Z scales) may not be able to draw that amount of current. You can adjust down this limit. Or, if for some reasons your acks seem to be too "trigger happy" you can make it less sensitive by raising this limit.

|hr-dashed|

``<D ACK MAX µS>`` - **Sets the ACK pulse maximum**

  *Parameters:* |BR|
  |_| > **µS:** ACK pulse duration in milliseconds upper bound
  
  *Response:* |BR|
  |_| N/A |BR| |BR|
  |_| *Notes:* |BR|
  |_| see MIN

|hr-dashed|

``<D ACK MIN µS>`` - **Sets the ACK pulse minimum**

  *Parameters:* |BR|
  |_| > **µS:** ACK pulsedureation in milliseconds lower bound
  
  *Response:* N/A

  *Notes:*
  
    The NMRA specifies that the ACK pulse duration should be 6 milliseconds, which is 6000 microseconds (µS), give or take 1000 µS. That means the minimum pulse duration is 5000 µS and the maximum is 7000 µS. There are many poorly designed decoders in existence so DCC-EX extends this range from 4000 to 8500 µS. If you have any decoders that still do not function within this range, you can adjust the ACK MIN and ACK MAX parameters.
