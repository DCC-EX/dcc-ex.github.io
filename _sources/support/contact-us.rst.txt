The best way to reach us is on our  `Discord Server </support/index.html#preferred-option-discord>`_. 

Usually there is a team member online to help with your issue in English, German and French, and if not you'll get a response within a few hours.

You can also find some of us on Facebook in the "DCC-EX, DCC++ and Arduino Model Railroading" private group. However many of the project team do not use Facebook, so this approach is **not recommended**.

and on TrainBoard. However very few of the project team do not use TrainBoard, so this approach is **not recommended**.
