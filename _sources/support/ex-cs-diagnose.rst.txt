This page s intended to help you diagnose and fix the most common problems with the |EX-CS|.

Depending on how you have your EX-CommandStation configured, the steps to diagnose problems are different:

* `When Connected to a PC via USB`_
* `When Configured as an Access Point`_
* `When Configured in Station mode`_

----

When Connected to a PC via USB
==============================

**If you have connected your EX-CommandStation to a PC via USB (including using JMRI)**

  :widths: 45 20 35
  :header-rows: 1
  :class: command-table

  * - Question 
    - If Yes
    - If No
  * - 1. Is the LED on the Arduino board on?
    - Go to Question 2.
    - You have not connected a 7-9v DC power supply to Arduino Board |BR| OR |BR| You have not connected a USB cable connected to a power supply, to Arduino Board
  * - 2. Can your phone see the WiFi network of the EX-CommandStation in the phone's available network list?
    - Go to Question 3
    - xx
  * - 3. Can your phone connect the WiFi network of the EX-CommandStation
    - Go to Question 4
    - xx
  * - 4. Can your throttle app connect the wiThrottle server of the EX-CommandStation |BR| |BR| |Engine Driver| should show you the wiThrottle server in the discovered servers list |BR| For |wiThrottle| you will need to type in the IP address and Port
    - Go to Question 5
    - xx
  * - 5. Can you turn the track power on?  |BR| Do the LEDs on the moto shield turn on?
    - Go to Question 6
    - Have you plugged in and turned on a 12-15v DC power supply into the moto shield |BR| OR |BR| Have you made sure the polarity of the power supply is correct. |BR| OR |BR|
