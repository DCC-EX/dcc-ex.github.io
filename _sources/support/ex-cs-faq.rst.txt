  * - Why Can't I Put an EX-RAIL Script on an SDCard?
    - Being able to read an SD card on the Arduino platforms requires a significant amount of code because there is no operating system or file system which we would take for granted on a PC. We simply donâ€™t have enough free memory on an Arduino to hold that code. |BR| |BR| See :ref:`ex-rail/about:why can't i put a script on an sdcard?` for more information.
