Frequently Asked Questions & Troubleshooting
============================================

We've done our best to capture a lot of common questions we've provided answers to via our various support methods, along with providing some troubleshooting tips on the various issues you may encounter with our products.

The following pages provide these FAQs and troubleshooting guides, and the following sections on this page outline how to get help if these don't resolve the issue.

Contact & Support options
=========================

There are several different ways to get in contact with the team and obtain help and support for |DCC-EX|.

Preferred option: Discord
-------------------------

The best way to reach us is on our Discord server. Usually there is a team member online to help with your issue, and if not you'll get a response within a few hours.

Discord allows for live chatting rather than just a back and forth offline support process, so you can join a live conversation with the |DCC-EX| team members and other |DCC-EX| users.

This is a great way not just to get support, but also to share ideas and feedback and maybe even get some inspiration for that new layout or automation idea that's tickling the back of your mind.

For those who wish to contribute to the project, this is by far the best option for working with the team, as we can also include you in our private development conversations.
