You can also send an email to support@dcc-ex.com. We try to follow FaceBook and JMRI groups, but there are just too many separate groups to see and respond to all the messages.

Lastly, you can find us on TrainBoard. `DCC++ EX TrainBoard Forum <https://www.trainboard.com/highball/index.php?forums/dcc.177/>`_
