*The best way to reach us is on our Discord server.* 

Usually there is a team member online to help with your issue, and if not you'll get a response within a few hours.

Discord allows for live chatting rather than just a back and forth offline support process, so you can join a live conversation with the |DCC-EX| team members and other |DCC-EX| users.

This is a great way not just to get support, but also to share ideas and feedback and maybe even get some inspiration for that new layout or automation idea that's tickling the back of your mind.

For those who wish to contribute to the project, this is by far the best option for working with the team, as we can also include you in our private development conversations.

Other options
-------------

email
^^^^^

You can also send an email to support@dcc-ex.com.

Facebook
^^^^^^^^

We try to follow FaceBook and JMRI groups, but there are just too many separate groups to see and respond to all the messages.

You can find some of us on Facebook in the "DCC-EX, DCC++ and Arduino Model Railroading" private group. However many of the project team do not use Facebook at all, so this approach is **not recommended**.

`Arduino for Model Railroading <https://www.facebook.com/groups/926390087391995/>`_

There is also another group you you can join here:

`DCC++ and Arduino Model Railroading <https://www.facebook.com/groups/1406785379394934/>`_

TrainBoard
^^^^^^^^^^

You can also find a few of us on TrainBoard. However very few of the project team use TrainBoard, so this approach is **not recommended**.

`DCC++ EX TrainBoard Forum <https://www.trainboard.com/highball/index.php?forums/dcc.177/>`_
