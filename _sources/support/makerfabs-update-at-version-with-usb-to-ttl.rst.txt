Unfortunately the Espressif ESP8266 based WiFi Boards that are available for sale routinely come with versions of the firmware that simply do not work with |EX-CS|. This now seems to include the recommended `Makerfabs ESP8266 WiFi Shield <https://www.makerfabs.com/esp8266-wifi-shield.html>`_.

Introduction
============

Out of the box, the MakerFabs ESP8266 shield appears to be shipping with a broken firmware that is unstable when used with DCC-EX. To flash version 1.7.4 onto the board follow these instructions.

.. note:: 
   
   These instructions are specific to using Makerfabs' own **CP2104 USB to Serial Converter Arduino Programmer**, not USB to TTL boards from other manufacturers.

Requirements
============

* The WiFi Shield itself - https://www.makerfabs.com/esp8266-wifi-shield.html
* An CP2104 USB to Serial Converter Arduino Programmer - https://www.makerfabs.com/cp2104-usb-to-serial-converter.html
* 4x female to male jumper wires
* 2x male to male jumper wire
* The flash download tool - https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools
* Firmware - ????
* A Windows PC

How To
======

Step 1 - Set up the download tool
---------------------------------

1. Extract both the download tool and firmware files zips
2. Do not connect the USB yet

Step 2 - Connect the Jumper Wires
---------------------------------

Connect the following:

1. Adjust the switch to 5V
2. Connect jumpers from the **ESP12F USB to Serial Converter** to the **WiFi Shield** as follows:
 
   * VCC --> 5V
   * GND --> GND
   * RXD --> ESP_TX
   * TXD --> ESP_R
   * BOOT --> GPIO0
   * RES --> RST

Step 3 - Start the flashing
---------------------------

1. Plug a USB cable into to PC and the **CP2104 USB to Serial Converter Arduino Programmer**.
2. Start Espressif's download tool.
3. Select ESP8266 and set it as follows:

   * It is recommended to increase the baud rate to 1152000, which will make the download faster.
   * In the first field of the tool you need to enter the location of the firmware file (.bin file) that you downloaded. |br| You can use the :guilabel:`...` button to the right of the field to browse for the file. |br| If the file can be found by the tool, the field will turn green.
   * Set the other radio buttons, drop lists and checkboxes as per the image below.
   
6. Click :guilabel:`START` |br| |br| If there is no response, repeat step 2. |br|
7. Wait for the download to complete.
8. A successful result should look like:

Step 4 - Use the WiFi shield
----------------------------

You should now be able to disconnect the jumpers, place the shield it onto your DCC-EX setup, and if all went well it should work.
