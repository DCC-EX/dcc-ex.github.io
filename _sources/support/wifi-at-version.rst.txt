Unfortunately the Espressif ESP8266 based WiFi Boards that are available for sale routinely come with versions of the firmware that simply do not work with |EX-CS|. This now seems to include the recommended `Makerfabs ESP8266 WiFi Shield <https://www.makerfabs.com/esp8266-wifi-shield.html>`_.

Which is correct version of the AT firmware
===========================================

Only **version 1.7.4** is known to work reliably.  

That means all versions both before or after 1.7.4 are *not* suitable.  So don't be fooled in thinking that if it has a version later than that it will be ok.  **It won't!**

Symptoms of an Incorrect firmware Version
=========================================

There several common symptoms of a an incorrect firmware version

* You can't connect to the SSID
* You can connect to the SSID, but can't connect your WiFi throttle to the CommandStation (e.g. Engine Driver or wiThrottle)
* You can connect once, but it will not connect again unless you shut down the |EX-CS|

Find out Your AT Version
========================

It is important to find out which version of the firmware you board has and correct it if necessary.

There are two basic ways that you can check:

* After you load the |EX-CS| software
* Before you load the |EX-CS| software

Checking after you load the |EX-CS| software
--------------------------------------------

One you have loaded the |EX-CS| software you will be able to see the AT version in the start-up log by connecting the serial monitor in either the |EX-I| or Arduino IDE (whichever you used to upload the |EX-CS| onto your device).

Checking using EX-Installer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have successfully loaded the |EX-CS| software:

1. click back through the pages of the |EX-I| till you get to the 'Select your Device' screen
2. Click on the :guilabel:`View device monitor` button |BR| A new window will open and a lot of text will appear
3. you need to look for a line that will have a section highlighted in green

e.g. ``AT version:1.7.4.0(May 11 2020 19:13:04)``

Alternately, you can enter the command ``<+GMR>`` and click :guilabel:`Send`.  A similar line will be shown.

If it says **anything other than** 1.7.4 in that line, then you have the wrong version you will need to follow the instructions at the end of this page to correct it.

Checking with the Arduino IDE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you loaded the |EX-CS| software using the Arduino, once you have successfully loaded the |EX-CS| software:

1. select **Tools** -> **Serial monitor** from the menus
2. A new pane will open at the bottom of the IDE window will open and a lot of text will appear
3. you need to look for a line similar to the following

e.g. ``AT version:1.7.4.0(May 11 2020 19:13:04)``

Alternately, you can enter the command ``<+GMR>`` and click :guilabel:`Send`.  A similar line will be shown.

If it says **anything other than** 1.7.4 in that line, then you have the wrong version you will need to follow the instructions at the end of this page to correct it.


Checking before you load the |EX-CS| software
---------------------------------------------

How to check before you load the |EX-CS| software will depend on which WiFi shield or board you are using.

Checking ESP-01
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. todo:: `Checking AT version ESP-01 prior to upload`

Checking with a USB Serial Adapter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Connect the ESP01 to the serial adapter
2. Plug the serial adapter it the PC
3. oOpen the Arduino IDE 
4. Select **Tools** -> **Serial monitor** from the menus
5. Select baud: ``115200`` and ``Both NL & CR``
6. A new pane will open at the bottom of the IDE window will open
7. Enter the command ``AT+GMR`` and click :guilabel:`Send`.

It will reply with something like ``AT version:1.7.4.0(May 11 2020 19:13:04)``

If it says **anything other than** 1.7.4 in that line, then you have the wrong version you will need to follow the instructions at the end of this page to correct it.

Checking with a USB to TTL CH340G Converter Module Adapter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Checking with a Arduino Uno

Checking ESP8266 Wifi Shield
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Checking Duinopeak ESP8266 WiFi Expansion Board 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



Checking Mega+WiFi
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

----

What to do if you have the wrong version
========================================

The steps necessary to correct the version will depend on you hardware.

We highly recommend upgrading or downgrading to the "NonOS AT" version 1.7.4 available on our :doc:`/download/esp8266` download page prior to reaching out for support from the team.
