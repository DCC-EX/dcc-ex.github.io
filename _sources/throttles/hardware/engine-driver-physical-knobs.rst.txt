Adding a Physical Dial/Knob to Engine Driver
********************************************

While it is easy to use a BlueTooth gamepad with the |Engine Driver| app that doesn't allow for for a dial or slider.

It is possible to easily add a rotary dial (knob) to |Engine Driver| due its ability to control the throttle using the volume hardware buttons on the smart device (Phone / Tablet) and the ready availability of USB volume dials / knobs.
