All the Android based throttle apps listed can be run on Microsoft Windows PCs.

There are a least two methods:

- Using *BlueStacks*
- Using *Windows Subsystem for Android*

BlueStacks
==========

The `BlueStacks <https://www.bluestacks.com/>`_ app allows you to install and run most Android apps on most recent Windows PCs.

It has the advantages of:

- Works on most recent Windows PCs
- User Friendly installation of apps
- Allows you to run multiple instances of same app at the same time

Disadvantages include:

- Has advertisements

Follow the instructions on their `site <https://www.bluestacks.com/>`_ to install BlueStacks, then get the appropriate .apk to install the throttle app you want.  e.g. The Engine Driver .apk is available from the `Engine Driver site <https://enginedriver.mstevetodd.com/downloads>`_`

Windows Subsystem for Android
=============================

`Windows Subsystem for Android <https://https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/android/wsa//>`_ is a built in feature of Windows 11 that allows you to install and run most Android apps on *some* Windows PCs.

It has the advantages of:

- Built in feature of Windows 11
- No Advertisements

Disadvantages include:

- Only works of Windows 11 PCs with an SSD (not a physical Hard Drive)
- Not very user friendly installation (sideloading) of non-Amazon approved apps (i.e. the throttle apps)
- Does *not* allow you to run multiple instances of same app at the same time

Follow the instructions `here <https://www.windowscentral.com/how-sideload-android-apps-using-wsa-windows-11>`_ `or here <https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-sideload-android-apps-on-windows-11/>`_ to setup Windows Subsystem for Android to allow 'sideloading'.

You will need to install the `SDK Platform Tools <https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools>`_.

You will also need to get the appropriate .apk to install the throttle app you want.  e.g. The Engine Driver .apk is available from the `Engine Driver site <https://enginedriver.mstevetodd.com/downloads>`_`
