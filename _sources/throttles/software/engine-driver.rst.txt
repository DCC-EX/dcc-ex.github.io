**Engine Driver** (ED) is an Android App that uses the |WiThrottle Protocol| *or* the |DCC-EX Native Commands| to connect directly to the |EX-CS| via WiFi. It can also connect to the JMRI WiThrottle Server via WiFi using the |WiThrottle Protocol|. 

If you wish to connect Engine Driver directly to |EX-CS|, you need to add a WiFi option to your |EX-CS| as explained here: :doc:`WiFi Setup </ex-commandstation/get-started/wifi-setup>`.

If you wish to connect Engine Driver to |JMRI|, you need to start the |WiThrottle Server| and (optionally [#]_) the Web Server in JMRI on the computer running |JMRI|. The |JMRI| computer must be connected to the |EX-CS| using a USB cable.

Using a Bluetooth Controller
=============================
This is the one Steve Todd uses himself on a lanyard. It leaves both hands free for paperwork and uncoupling and is light enough to simply let go of when you need both hands. Here are his optimised settings. His preferred settings are listed in the note below. You can use these as a start and customise them for your own use:

And here is another Bluetooth controller that provides extra function buttons and you can hold by placing your finger in the ring.

.. Note:: From Steve: I set speedsteps to 10, change amount to 1, repeat delay to 9999, horizontal switching layout, throttle web view. I acquire loco/consist using my phone, then dim & lock and put phone in my holster. Then I can "bump" the joystick up and down 3,2,1,0,-1,-2,-3, easily keeping track of the current "notch". 1 is coupling speed, 2 is switching/yard speed, 3 is mainline. If I'm at home, I put the Conductor view in the web and I have my work for each location.

Adding a Physical Dial (Knob) 
==============================

It is possible to easily add a rotary dial (knob) to |Engine Driver|.  see :doc:`/throttles/hardware/engine-driver-physical-knobs` for more information.

Recording a log file in EngineDriver
====================================

If you are having difficulties with Engine Driver connecting to an |EX-CS| it is very helpful if you can provide the support team with a log file of when the problem occurs.

To record a log file in EngineDriver:

1. Start ED.
2. From the menu, select 'View Log'
3. Click 'Start recording to a file'
4. Click 'Close'
5. Attempt whatever is causing the problem a few times
6. Exit ED
7. Connect a USB cable to your phone and PC 
8. Allow access if the phone asks.
9. In some versions of Android you may also need to change the connection type on the phone from 'charging' to 'file transfer'
10. Open a file manager and find the connected phone
11. Browse down to the folder ...\Internal shared storage\Android\data\jmri.enginedriver\files
12. Find the most resent file that looks like logcatxxxxxxxxxxxxx.txt     e.g. logcat1699833098998.txt
13. Attach that file to a message here in discord using the paperclip button on the toolbar above the message content
