`Get it on the Apple App Store <https://apps.apple.com/au/app/train-driver/id1558334503>`_

Train Driver is a multi protocol model train mobile controller

The app is driving digital model trains supporting several digital centrals with their different protocols. The app is developed by a model train enthusiast for other model train enthusiasts.

The focus is on a mobile locomotive controller and is therefore currently limited to only control locomotives. For this purpose, up to 3 locomotives are supported at the same time. At the iPad in landscape format all 3 locomotives are displayed in one screen and can be controlled easily together. At the iPhone controllers can be switched easily, but only one controller is displayed.


Following protocols are supported:

- SRCP including MFX extension
- Z21 from Fleischmann / Roco
- WiThrottle as used e.g. in JMRI or DCC++EX
- DCC++EX

In order to control a locomotive, the app must be connected to a control center. A small red point flashes at the bottom right of the symbol. Now the locomotive can be set. Again a small red point flashes at the bottom right of the symbol.

Now you can start and operate the locomotive using the function buttons or the speed slider.
