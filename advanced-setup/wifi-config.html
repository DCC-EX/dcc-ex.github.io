<h2>Wireless Connections<a class="headerlink" href="#wireless-connections" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned in <a class="reference external" href="../get-started/wifi-setup.html">WiFi Setup</a>, there are two main reasons for wanting to use WiFi; to connect to JMRI without a USB cable, or to connect to a WiThrottle controller like the Engine Driver mobile app. In addition, you have two options for connecting your WiThrottle Controller to your Command Station. If you are using JMRI, you can leave your CS connected to the JMRI computer via the USB cable and connect your Controller via WiFi to the WiThrottle server running on the JMRI computer. If you don’t need JMRI or just want to connect your WiFi Controller directly to the CS, then you connect to the WiThrottle Server running on your CS.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-a-withrottle-server">
<h2>What’s a “WiThrottle Server”?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-s-a-withrottle-server" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>WiThrottle stands for “WiFi Throttle” and a “WiThrottle Server” is just software running on your JMRI computer or on the DCC-EX Command Station. It’s called a “server” because it allows you to connect to it and it “serves” or provides service to you via another application. That application is called a “Client”. So your throttle in this case is the client.</p>
<p>WiThrottle itself is a standard for how WiFi throttles can communicate with Command Stations much like the DCC standard is a standard for how data packets are communicate to decoders. What this means for you, is that any device that is WiThrottle compatible should work with DCC-EX.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ap-mode-vs-station-mode">
<h2>AP Mode vs. Station Mode<a class="headerlink" href="#ap-mode-vs-station-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are two ways to setup the Wifi chip connected to DCC++: “Access Point Mode” (aka “AP MODE) and “Station Mode”. We often abbreviate the latter to “STA”. You will also see people refer to it as “Client Mode”.</p>
<p>In AP mode the tiny ESP chip acts as a very basic Wifi base and provides a small IP network for your throttle or for your computer running JMRI and WiThrottle. In this mode there is no connection to the Internet for any of the devices only connected to the AP of the ESP chip.</p>
<p>In STA (Client) mode the ESP chip uses an existing (home) Wifi network and connects to that along with all the other devices you might have in your home. If you have a stable Wifi network where you place your Command Station this is a good choice because the Wifi Station of your home network is normally better in managing all devices and the frequencies involved in runnung a stable Wifi network that the ESP chip.</p>
<p>We will focus on how to connect a Throttle to the Command Station. For info on using WiFi with JMRI, click here <strong>missing link</strong></p>
<div class="section" id="ap-mode">
<h3>AP Mode<a class="headerlink" href="#ap-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If there is no exising Wifi or the Wifi is still unconfigured, the default for DCC-EX is AP mode. In this mode, your CS acts like an AP. In other words, it acts just like any other wireless router you could connect to. The router in your home is in effect, an AP. Using the CS in AP mode allows you to have to separate network so you can keep your layout network separate from your home network. If you travel to shows or take your setup to a friend’s house, this allows for an autonomous, transportable system that does not need a connection to and hopefully will not interfere with, other networks. See <strong>dealing with interference (missing link)</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="station-mode-sta-mode">
<h3>Station Mode (STA Mode)<a class="headerlink" href="#station-mode-sta-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Station mode allows you to connect the Command Station to your existing home network. The CS becomes a Station or Client rather than an AP. That means instead of being an AP which manages the IP of the smartphone that contains your Throttle, it becomes a station that connects to your existing network. The Throttle then connects to the CS by finding its IP address on the network.</p>

<h2>Default Operation - AP Mode (No Configuration Necessary)<a class="headerlink" href="#default-operation-ap-mode-no-configuration-necessary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To use the default AP mode, you don’t have to do anything other than connect an ESP8266 board as described in <a class="reference external" href="../get-started/wifi-setup.html">WiFi Setup</a>. That’s it! We find your device, no matter which of the extra serial ports you attached it to and create a WiThrottle server running and waiting for you to connect to. All you need to know is the IP address assigned by the WiFi board and the port to communicate through. You can find this using the Arduino Serial Monitor.</p>
<p>Whenever you connect a USB cable and open the serial monitor, you reset the program running on your CS. It will go through the bootup sequence and try to connect to a network. If you did not setup a “Station Mode” configuration, or if that network is not in range, it will configure itself in AP mode. You will see this process by watching the serial monitor log window. Here are the important lines you need to look for. While the IP address is almost always 192.168.4.1, it could be different on your system. You are looking for the items in the blue box below that are highlighted in red</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/ap_mode1.jpg"><img alt="IP Address" src="../_images/ap_mode1.jpg" style="width: 514.4px; height: 404.0px;" /></a>
<p><strong>Figure 1</strong> - Serial Monitor Log (click to enlarge)</p>
<p>You will see the line that has <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AT+CIPSERVER=1,2560\r\r\nno</span> <span class="pre">change\r\n\r\nOK\r\n</span></code>, where 2560 is your port number</p>
<p>Next you will see <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">+CIFSR:APIP,&quot;192.168.4.1&quot;</span></code>, where your IP address is 192.168.4.1.</p>
<p>AP IP here stands for “Access Point IP Address”. Your throttle is assigned an IP in the same IP range, typically 192.168.4.10 to 15. As in this case your AP is at the same time your DCC-EX CS, you connect your throttle to the AP IP. Remember to enter it correctly into your WiFi Throttle when you configure that later.</p>
<p>Once you see an AP IP Address and see <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">`++</span> <span class="pre">Wifi</span> <span class="pre">Setup</span> <span class="pre">OK</span> <span class="pre">++</span></code> at the bottom of the log (it may take a few seconds for the CS to complete the configuration), you can connect to it. See the next section.</p>
<div class="section" id="connecting-to-the-ap">
<h3>Connecting to the AP<a class="headerlink" href="#connecting-to-the-ap" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are two steps to get you running trains with your WiFi throttle, the first is to connect to the AP instead of your home network, the second is to connect your throttle to the AP.</p>
<p>On your mobile device, go into your WiFi settings that same way you would to connect to your home router. Look for another network to connect to. You should see a new network that begins with “DCCEX” like this: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DCCEX_6e321b</span></code></p>
<p>Note that the last 6 letters and numbers will be specific to your WiFi board and uniquely identify it. They are the last 6 letters of that device’s MAC address.</p>
<p>Simply click on that network and connect to it. You will need to enter the password you specified in the config.h file. Ignore the warning that may popup telling you that “Internet may not be available”. The CS is not connected to the internet and you are connecting your mobile device directly to it. Depending on the config and OS of your device you may still have Internet over mobile data through a cell tower connection. If you wish to use your home network internet (for example if your data plan is expensive), turn off mobile data and see the section below on Station Mode to connect using your home network instead.</p>
<p>Once you are connected to the CS, you can run your WiFi Throttle program, enter the IP Address for the Server Address (the default is usually 192.168.4.1, but it will be displayed in your serial monitor log if you are unsure), 2560 for the Port number, and then select and acquire your loco by its address.</p>

<h2>Connecting to your Network - Station Mode (edit config.h)<a class="headerlink" href="#connecting-to-your-network-station-mode-edit-config-h" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In order to connect to your home network, you must open the config.h file in a text editor and enter your login credentials or you have already entered your credentials via the installer. The easiest way to do this is to use the Arduino IDE and open the project. Look for these lines in the file:</p>

</div>
<p>Figure 2 - Station Mode Configuration</p>
<p>First, make sure that the #define ENABLE_WIFI true line is not commented out. two slashes <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">//</span></code> in front of a line make it a comment and not a line of code</p>
<p>Next, enter your network information into the WIFI_SSID, WIFI_PASSORD and WIFI_HOSTNAME fields. Here is an example:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">#define WIFI_SSID &quot;JonesFamily&quot;</span>
<span class="c1">#define WIFI_PASSWORD &quot;Secret!2020&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We recommend leaving WIFI_HOSTNAME to “dccex”, but you can change it if you like. If your ESP8266 WiFi board has a later version of firmware, that can allow you to connect using this name instead of the IP address. In other words, it allows that name to be an alias for the IP address.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="resetting-network-settings">
<h2>Resetting Network Settings<a class="headerlink" href="#resetting-network-settings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once you enter a network SSID and password, the CS will always try to connect to it, even after removing the power and restarting. If you want to connect in AP mode, or your network credentials change, or you need to connect to a different network, you simply need to tell your WiFi board to clear the settings.</p>
<p>Go into your serial monitor and wait until the CS has gone through the startup sequence. Then in command textbox enter <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">+CWQAP</span></code></p>
<p>and press “SEND”.</p>
<p>You will then see an “Ok” message. The WiFi Settings are forgotten. However, if the last config.h used when you uploaded it to the CS had WiFi Credentials in it, then as soon as your CS restarts, it will load and save those settings again. So…</p>

Use a serial monitor connected to the USB port of your CS and enter the commands you need. Remember that if you disconnect the serial monitor and reconnect it (or anything else) to the USB port, it will reset the CS and it will go back to the default configuration. Remember to press “send” after each command.</p>
