#: ../index.rst:44
msgid "To achieve that, DCC++ EX provides the model railroad community with a complete, open source DCC (Digital Command Control) system - one that is simple, affordable, and expandable, to control model trains and accessories. Further, it is our goal that this project be organized, documented, and maintained so that it can continue far into the future."
