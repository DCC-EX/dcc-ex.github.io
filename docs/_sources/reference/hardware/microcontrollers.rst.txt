Microcontrollers
================

DCC++ EX is compatible with many Arduino microcontollers. Out of the box, CommandStation-EX will work with the following boards:

* Arduino Uno
* Arduino Mega
* Arduino Nano

We recommend the Mega board since it is inexpensive (you can buy clone boards for under $10 US), it has a lot more GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins so you can expand and connect more sensors, turnouts, leds and accessories, and it has more memory. If you intend to add options like neworking, an I2C Display or anything that adds to the size of the program, you may need the extra memory.

And here is an Elegoo version:
