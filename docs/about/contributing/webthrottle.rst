Firstly, thank you for wanting to get involved with EX-WebThrottle2! Any contribution, no matter how big or small, is very much appreciated!

This page should give a step by step guide to contributing, from getting the tools you'll need to making the pull request. These steps are:

- Get the tools
- Read our code standards
- Make a branch
- Create commits
- Open a pull request

Developer tools
===============

.. note::
	You may want to have a look at our page on :doc:`/about/contributing/software` and also our page on :doc:`/about/contributing/github` if you've never used git or GitHub before

We strongly recommend using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) to work on EX-WebThrottle2. 
You can download it from Microsoft's website `here <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`__ |EXTERNAL-LINK|.
Whilst you are waiting for it to install, you can be getting a local copy of the code.

Once you have downloaded VSCode and installed it, open VSCode then click :menuselection:`File --> Open Workspace from file...` then find your local copy of the code and select "EX-WebThrottle2.code-workspace". 
Once VSCode has loaded the workspace, you should see a popup in the bottom right asking you if you want to install the recommended extensions. 
It's recommended you install these and they are:

- `Volar <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar>`__ |EXTERNAL-LINK|
- `Vuetify <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vuetifyjs.vuetify-vscode>`__ |EXTERNAL-LINK|
- `ESLint <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint>`__ |EXTERNAL-LINK|
- `Spell Checker <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker>`__ |EXTERNAL-LINK|

You'll need to set up Volar to handle TypeScript, instead of the built in TypeScript extension. To do this, follow these steps:

#. Open the command palette (:menuselection:`View --> Command Palette`)
#. Run Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions command
#. Find TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
#. Reload VSCode, and then open any vue file to trigger Volar activation (no longer need in 0.28.4).

Next you'll need to install Node.js to run the development tools. Again, you can download it from their website `here <https://nodejs.org/en/>`__ |EXTERNAL-LINK|.
We recommend you use the LTS version of Node.

Once Node is installed, open a terminal in VSCode (:menuselection:`Terminal --> New terminal`) and run the following command to install all the dependencies:

.. code-block:: shell

	npm install


Then to run the code locally:

.. code-block:: shell

	npm run dev

Code standards
--------------

For EX-WebThrottle2, we follow the `Google Style Guides <https://google.github.io/styleguide/>`__ |EXTERNAL-LINK|, specifically the `HTML/CSS <https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html>`__ |EXTERNAL-LINK| and `TypeScript <https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html>`__ |EXTERNAL-LINK| style guides. 
This means we use a indent of two spaces and single quotes for strings. 
Also, although semicolons are optional in JavaScript, we have configured the linter to enforce semicolons. 
If you have installed the recommended extensions, VSCode should highlight problems for you. 
You can also find (and fix some) problems using the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

	npm run lint

Development process
===================

Branches
--------
Here is a summary of what different branches are used for.

Main branches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two 'main' branches, ``main`` and ``next-release``. These branches can't be pushed to directly, instead you need to create a pull request.
``main`` is the branch for the current release cycle and ``next-release`` is for the next release cycle. You should only open a pull request to ``main`` if you are submitting a fix for bugfix release.

Development branches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Members of DCC-EX**

Branches should be named based off the feature they are for, and if multiple people are working on the same feature, you can make branches named ``feature-name/username``.
If you are developing a patch for the current release, you can use the same naming scheme but branch from ``main`` instead.

**Everyone else**

It doesn't really matter how you work in your fork, just make sure you open your pull request to the right branch (discussed further down in :ref:`about/contributing/webthrottle:opening a pull request`).

Commits
-------

Please make sure that when you name a commit it accurately describes the contents of the commit and has a prefix to describe the type of the commit.
These prefixes are:

- WIP: A feature or fix that isn't finished yet
- Fix: a finished fix with a reference to the GitHub issue
- Feat: A finished feature
- Chore: Code maintenance such as adding comments or removing dead code

An example would be: |BR|
*WIP: Add a new button* |BR|
Or |BR|
*Fix: button now works (#52)*

If you feel able to, please consider signing your commits (See this guide if you want to have a go: `Verified commits - GitHub <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification>`__ |EXTERNAL-LINK|).


Opening a pull request
======================

Before you open a pull request, consider running the following commands:

.. code-block:: shell

	npm run test:unit
	npm run test:e2e

These commands run our automated tests and should highlight if you have broken any other code. 
If you can't or forget, don't worry, these will be run when your pull request is submitted automatically. 

If you have added large amounts of new functionality, it would also be great if you could write tests to go with it, if you know how to do it.

Both ``main`` and ``next-release`` have branch protection, meaning you can't push to them directly, instead you have to open a pull request.
The branch ``next-release`` will be used to collect features for the next point release (major or minor), so this is the branch to base your branches on for new features, whilst ``main`` is used to prepare bugfix releases. 
Make sure you open a pull request to the right one!

Once you've opened your pull request, one of our team will have a look and get it merged into the code. 
Congratulations, you have contributed to EX-WebThrottle2!
