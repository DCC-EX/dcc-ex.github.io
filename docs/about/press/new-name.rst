***********************
Our New Name [Aug 2022]
***********************

We have changed our name from **'DCC++ EX'** to |DCC-EX|, dropping the **'++'**.

We have also changed our product names to have a consistent form of **EX-<product name>** (without spaces in the product names if there are multiple words).

|EX-CS| |_| |_| |EX-I| |_| |_| |EX-R| |_| |_| |EX-WT| |_| |_| |EX-TT| |_| |_| |EX-DCCI|

To go along with it we have created logos for the individual products

|EX-CS-LOGO-SMALL| |EX-I-LOGO-SMALL| |EX-WT-LOGO-SMALL| |EX-R-LOGO-SMALL| |EX-TT-LOGO-SMALL| |EX-DCCI-LOGO-SMALL| |EX-BSC-LOGO-SMALL|

Why did we do this
__________________

* Moved on from the original DCC++...
* Confusion between the team and the Command Station...  DCC++EX term used interchangeably
* difficult to pronounce
* some products used the EX- prefix and others used the -EX suffix


Yet To Do  
_________
(These still refer to to DCC++EX and will be changed over time) :

* Discord
* GitHub
* FaceBook  

Won't do
________

* internal code references the <DCC++> codes/commands
* |BSC| won't be renamed but does get a new logo

.. todo:: URGENT Need text for the new name page
