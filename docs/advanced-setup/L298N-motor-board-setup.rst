The L298N Motor board is the same H-Bridge on the Arduino Motor Shield. Here are the key differences:

* It is in a much smaller form factor
* It isn't a shield so you have to jumper wires to connect it to your CS
* It doesn't have current sense, so you are going to have to use one of the solutions below
* It stands vertically on the board with a big heat sink for better controlling

***TODO: More description to come***
