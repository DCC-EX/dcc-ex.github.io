Teensy
************

It's teensy because it is even smaller than a nano, but it is even more powerful than a Nano Every. This is not an Arduino, it is from a company called PJRC. Since it is a different processor, there are a lot of changes in the software that load onto the teensy when you select that as your processor.

* 180 MHz ARM Cortex-M4 with Floating Point Unit
* 1M Flash, 256K RAM, 4K EEPROM
* Microcontroller Chip MK66FX1M0VMD18
* MK66FX1M0VMD18 USB High Speed (480 Mbit/sec) Port 
* 2 CAN Bus Ports 
* 32 General Purpose DMA Channels 
* 22 PWM Outputs 
* 4 I2C Ports 
* 11 Touch Sensing Inputs 
* 62 I/O Pins (42 breadboard friendly) 
* 25 Analog Inputs to 2 ADCs with 13 bits resolution 
* 2 Analog Outputs (DACs) with 12 bit resolution 
* 22 PWM Outputs USB Full Speed (12 Mbit/sec) 
* Port Ethernet mac, capable of full 100 Mbit/sec speed 
* Native (4 bit SDIO) 
* micro SD card port 
* I2S Audio Port 
* 4 Channel Digital Audio Input & Output 
* 14 Hardware Timers 
* Cryptographic Acceleration Unit 
* Random Number Generator 
* CRC Computation Unit 
* 6 Serial Ports (2 with FIFO & Fast Baud Rates) 
* 3 SPI Ports (1 with FIFO) 
* 4 I2C Ports Real Time Clock

The only downside is that PJRC is a very small company, it doesn't have the resources or the staff of Arduino or Expressif.
