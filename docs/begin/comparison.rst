Introduction
============

A common question we see is why should someone choose our |EX-CS| over the many commercial systems that are available. This page is a *brief discussion* of some of the advantages and disadvantages of |EX-CS| and the whole |DCC-EX| ecosystem. (To see a detailed list of specific features of various systems we would recommend looking at the `DCC Wiki <https://dccwiki.com/Command_Stations_List>`_.)

First and foremost, there is nothing fundamentally wrong with any of the commercial offerings. While we believe strongly in our products, the commercial systems do have some advantages such as pretty packaging, a corporate structure, and more local purchasing options. (See below.)


Areas of Comparison
-------------------

This page will compare the following areas in broad generic terms:

Cost
^^^^

Hands down, the |EX-CS| is the lowest cost DCC Command Station option available. 

Depending on the configuration you choose, the least expensive commercial system will be three, or more, times more expensive than a |EX-CS|.  Also, it won't have a fraction of the built in features (see below) that the |EX-CS| has, which you will likely have to pay additionally for in the commercial systems, if they have those features at all.

|hr-dashed|

Purchasing
^^^^^^^^^^

While DCC-EX has several resellers spread over the world, many commercial systems have a larger established reseller network. 

You can walk into store and pick up a commercial Command Station in a box with comprehensive manuals and be reasonably assured that most of what you need is included and it will work out of the box.

The |EX-CS| has two options, the first is Ready-To-Run and the second is Do-It-Yourself (DIY). The Ready-To-Run option is our |EX-CSB1| which is a complete Command Station and/or Booster on one board. All you need is to plug your power supply into an outlet and connect the track outputs to you layout. It comes with software already installed and is the closest thing to what you would expect with a commercial "boxed" CS.

The Do-It-Yourself option is where you purchase a microcontroller (such as an Arduino or Elegoo Mega), a motor shield (like the |EX-MS|, and optionally, a WiFi board (like the |EX-WS|). While we now have resellers that can supply a complete system, most people purchase parts from different suppliers online. Parts can therefore take some time to arrive, and there is a little more work involved in sourcing and ensuring the quality of parts. So in general it is not as plug-and-play.

Setup complexity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you purchase a |EX-CSB1| or a complete Mega or ESPDuino32 system from one of our resellers, your experience will be similar to purchasing a commercial system minus the fancy packaging and, in some cases, having to provide your own enclosure if you require one.

For a complete DIY system, loading the software, assembling the boards, making a case, etc. while not individually difficult steps, can be still be daunting for some people. That is why we created the |EX-CSB1|. However for those who are attracted to the challenge and bragging rights to say, "I built it myself!", we will always offer a DIY option. Like the building a kit loco or building, some people enjoy it, some don't. Choose the path that is best for you.

  Note: A common comment we hear is *"..but I don't know how to program..."*.  This is a misconception about how the |EX-CS| works. You DO NOT have to know anything about programming to setup an |EX-CS|.  If you can join rail/track together and answer some questions in the |EX-I|, then you can assemble an |EX-CS|.

  The |EX-I| program which runs on Windows, Mac and Linux hugely simplifies the software loading process to the point where you need know nothing about Arduino programming to be able to install the software, maintain it with updates or configure it.

Usability
^^^^^^^^^

Once the systems are setup, there is generally not a lot of difference in terms of usability between the commercial systems and an |EX-CS|.

While not functionally different, the area of greatest difference is that most of the commercial system come with some form of physical controller.  Most |EX-CS| owners use inexpensive, smart phones, or tablets to control their locos. Many people already have a phone they replaced sitting in a drawer or can get one cheap on ebay.

You can have/use physical controllers (not a phone, tablet or computer) with |EX-CS|, but that is an additional item to build or purchase. Note that there are multiple inexpensive physical throttle designs that you can build yourself. There is a list of throttles that work with |EX-CS| in our :ref:`throttles/index:throttles (controllers)` section.

Built in Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here the |EX-CS| shines.

DCC *and DC* loco control, Auto-Reverser, WiFi throttles, Rosters, |EX-R|, |JMRI| connectivity via WiFi or USB, Sensors, turnout/point control and other features that are built into |EX-CS| that *generally* require additional addons to the Commercial Systems.  For example, for one brand the USB connectivity add-on alone is more expensive the an entire |EX-CS|.

However, there are features that a built into some of the commercial systems that are not exactly *built into* the |EX-CS|, including:

- Hardware Throttle. |BR| Many commercial starter sets come with built-in throttles. |EX-CS| requires the use of some sort of external throttle. Most of which are free but are not *technically* part of the |EX-CS| ^.
- CV programming |BR| Many commercial starter sets can program CVs using the hardware in the box. |EX-CS| requires the use of |ED|, |JMRI| or |EX-WT| which, while are all free are not *technically* part of the |EX-CS| ^.
- FastClock.  For the |EX-CS| this is an optional extra.
- *Simple to use* Advanced Consisting

^ We don't consider this a negative, just a difference.  The out-of-the-box capability to use multiple external devices as throttle or to program decoders is flexible and powerful.

Options/Expansion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|EX-CS| fares very well in this space.

Over and above the extensive built in features (above), the |EX-CS| supports IoTT connectivity, |EX-TT|, |EX-IO|, with more to come.  |DCC-EX| is evolving on a daily basis. (See Community below.)

Having said that, most of the commercial system have different expansion options. However, some of these only go to fill in the features that come out of the box with the |EX-CS|.  In their favour they are generally plug and play, whereas the |DCC-EX| options require some tinkering.

|hr-dashed|

Support
^^^^^^^

With virtually 24/7 online support, we feel the DCC-EX option is unique. What other company let's you speak directly to the developers?

With commercial systems you usually get high quality support, replacement for faulty items, etc. The catch is that depending on where you are in the world and where the manufacturer is, there can be long turnarounds to get that support. Even longer to get replacements or repairs.

Because members of the |DCC-EX| team are located world-wide, there is usually someone that can help you within a few hours on our `Discord Server <https://discord.gg/sWNPUsg8>`_. 

Is you purchased an |EX-CSB1| or other system from a DCC-EX Reseller, support is available both from that reseller and online from the DCC-EX team and users. If you purchased parts and installed the software yourself, is up to you to deal with this side of the process. The positive is that, if you wish, the costs are so low that you can keep spares of most items and still be well under the total cost of a commercial system.

Community
^^^^^^^^^

|DCC-EX| is clear the winner here.

While the commercial systems have strong followings, and there are plenty of people on various forums that will be happy to discuss their systems or provide help, they can't compare to the |DCC-EX| community.

|DCC-EX| maintains a `Discord Server <https://discord.gg/sWNPUsg8>`_ where hundreds of people world-wide are actively engaged in discussing and evolving the |EX-CS| and its add-ons on a daily basis.  You can generally get answers to questions within a few hours and, if you interested, you easily find yourself in deep conversations about existing and upcoming features. 

|hr-dashed|

Non-proprietary / Open Source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The other aspect of |DCC-EX| that should not be taken lightly is that it is all *open source* using of-the-shelf or open source hardware. Everyone is free to use or modify our code and hardware designs as they see fit, for non-commercial use. This shows clearly in the volume and rate of features and options being continuously added by the team. We actively invite, encourage and support people who want to contribute to the products.

With the commercial systems, with a few exceptions (e.g. WiThrottle) use proprietary technology. You are locked into the vendor for most add-ons.

Conclusion
==========

As you can see from the points above and the `DCC Wiki <https://dccwiki.com/Command_Stations_List>`_ there is a bit of thought required to make a fair comparison. However, we believe that |EX-CS| can handle the needs of most modellers. 

Before proceeding with any system you should weigh up the pros and cons and come to a decision *you* feel comfortable with.
