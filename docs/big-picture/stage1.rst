What to expect to learn from stage 1
====================================

At the end of this stage, we expect you will have learnt the following:

* How run a train on your WiFi enabled |EX-CS|
* How run a train on your |JMRI| connected |EX-CS|
* How to run more than one train (Individual or Consist/Multiple Units)
* How to program a decoder using |JMRI|

Programming on the Main
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 There is such a thing as "Programming on Main", where you can adjust things like sounds, throttle curves, speed matching, etc., but you can't get acknowledgment back from the loco on the main track. That is usually fine because you will know if a setting like a sound change "took" or not. We will have a section on programming on main.
