What to expect to learn from stage 4
====================================

At the end of this stage, we expect you will have learnt the following:

* How add automations to your |EX-CS|

Recommended reading
===================

Throughout these pages we will be using |EX-R| functionality extensively, not just for automation, but also to define the various objects in use, and therefore we highly recommend being familiar with at least the basics of EX-RAIL, so it would be best to read through the :doc:`/ex-rail/getting-started` page prior to going any further.

We will also be outlining the equivalent DCC-EX commands for items where relevant, so it can be handy to refer to the :doc:`/reference/software/command-reference` where necessary.

Notes
=====

Locomotive addresses in use
---------------------------

For our various automations and sequences that involve driving trains, we will be using locomotives that represent the various international locations and preferred modelling eras of the |DCC-EX| team. Be warned that this means we will be mixing completely unrealistic combinations of eras on the same layout!

Here are the various locomotives you can find used throughout these examples:
