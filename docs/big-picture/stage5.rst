A turntable can add significant interest to a layout, especially when involved in operations sessions, and when depicting realistic engine yards.

In addition, turntables can be a real space saver compared to reversing loops, and traversers can also be significant space savers for staging tracks, allowing multiple trains to be staged ready for action without taking up spurs or sidings on the main layout when not in use.

When it comes to RMFT, we are adding a turntable that has seven defined positions, six of which are for entering roundhouse stalls, and the seventh is the track connecting to the rest of the layout via the switching/shunting yard.

In addition, we are also adding a horizontal staging traverser that will allow for six complete trains to be staged off the layout ready for action.

.. tip:: 

  In preparation for adding an |EX-TT| to your layout, you'll need to understand the concepts outlined on the :doc:`/ex-turntable/overview` page, paying particular attention to the section on polarity or phase switching (:ref:`ex-turntable/overview:important! phase (or polarity) switching`), as we will be using automatic phase switching for the turntable.

  Further to this, you'll also need to understand the differences required for traverser mode as outlined on the :doc:`/ex-turntable/traverser` page. We will not require phase switching for the traverser, as any locos on the traverser will not be rotating 180 degrees.

  If you won't be using a traverser on your layout or want to tackle this separately, you can skip the traverser info on this page as it is essentially an extension of the turntable info.

What to expect to learn from stage 5
====================================

At the end of this stage, we expect you will have learnt the following:

* How to add an |EX-TT| to your |EX-CS| in both turntable and traverser modes
* How to tune your |EX-TT| positions
* How to control and automate your |EX-TT|

Add an EX-Turntable to your EX-CommandStation
=============================================

Adding the turntable
--------------------

For the purposes of this exercise, we will assume you've acquired everything you need from the :doc:`/ex-turntable/purchasing` page, and have completed all steps up to and including :ref:`ex-turntable/assembly:7. load the ex-turntable software` on the :doc:`/ex-turntable/assembly` page.

Now that the basics of |EX-TT| have been completed and it is ready to be added to your |EX-CS|, we need to get it calibrated and connected ready for action.

Adding the traverser
--------------------

For the purposes of this exercise, we will assume you've acquired everything you need from the :doc:`/ex-turntable/purchasing` page with consideration of the changes for traverser mode as outlined in :ref:`ex-turntable/traverser:what you need for traverser mode`, and have completed all steps up to and including :ref:`ex-turntable/assembly:7. load the ex-turntable software` on the :doc:`/ex-turntable/assembly` page, as well as taking into account the changes required as outlined on the :doc:`/ex-turntable/traverser` page.
