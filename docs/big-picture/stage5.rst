A turntable can add significant interest to a layout, especially when involved in operations sessions, and when depicting realistic engine yards.

In addition, turntables can be a real space saver compared to reversing loops, and traversers can also be significant space savers for staging tracks, allowing multiple trains to be staged ready for action without taking up spurs or sidings on the main layout when not in use.

When it comes to RMFT, we are adding a turntable that has seven defined positions, six of which are for entering roundhouse stalls, and the seventh is the track connecting to the rest of the layout via the switching/shunting yard.
