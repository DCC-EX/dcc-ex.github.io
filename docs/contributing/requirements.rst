Requirements
**************

We assume, since you got here, that you already have a computer up and running being either a Linux, macOS, or Windows machine, as well as a working internet connection and some disk space available. 

A 64 bit operating system is preferred, running as much as possible the latest version of your chosen OS. This in any case is good practice to keep your environment healthy and up-to-date.

The following sections describe what else you need for participating in the different efforts.

Documentation
================

If you concentrate on documentation, no additional hardware requirements exist. Keep reading on, but be reassured if you don't feel comfortable with the following don't worry, we will find a way to have you contributing by other means.
Just go to the Contact Us section, and we will find a way of getting you on board, or help you out getting things set up.

reStructuredText
------------------

All documentation is done using reStructuredText, for which you can find information on the official website: `reStructuredText <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html>`_
or the `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_ document builder tool website, which we discuss later on in this chapter.
reStructuredText is a markdown type language, for typesetting documents from websites to PDF or LaTeX documents. Our Website is built upon this technology, so you should make yourself familiar with this by looking through the links provided.

reStructuredText `QuickReference Guide <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`_ 


Git & GitHub
--------------

You should have some knowledge about Git and GitHub, as we manage all of our documentation (as well as the development) there. Depending on the editing platform of your choice, you may get all the Git functionality you need. You may want to install GitHub Desktop or Sourcetree for getting a good idea on the state of the DCC++EX documentation GitHub repository (dcc-ex.github.io).

If you don't have Git installed, now is as good a time as any, follow the instructions in the `Pro Git book <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_

Download `GitHub Desktop <https://desktop.github.com/>`_

Download `SourceTree <https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/>`_

Editing
--------

You will also need to choose a text editor. Yes, any text editor will do, even the most simple one, but they will not provide editing help. We suggest you use the free VSC (Visual Studio Code) which provides additional components that will make your editing easier with syntax highlighting, text snippets, and live preview of the rendering of the file, as well as integration with GitHub. Using a simple text editor will require you handling the Git integration yourself.

Download VSC `here <https://code.visualstudio.com/download>`_ 

Install the following extensions:
rst

The final website will be rendered from the rst text files using Sphinx, which you also need to install with some options which you'll find in the next paragraph.

Sphinx
--------

Sphinx is a transformation tool, taking rst formatted documents and turning them into a static html website, PDF, or LaTex documents.

Sphinx needs Python v3, so if you don't have python installed, it's time to do this now.
Install python how-to ---TODO: to be done ---

Once this is done you should also add the following extension to VSC --- to be done --- in order to enable the live preview of the documentation you write.


Images
----------

We typically like compressed PNG files, but can take JPG as well. The resolution should be 72dpi and at least 600 pixels wide (maximum 1200). We can size the images using Sphinx to reduce them as necessary to fit where we need them on the page.

Graphs & Schemas
-----------------

Use draw.io to keep compatibility and allow group collaboration on the same document. Not everyone has access to Microsoft Visio. Export any schema or graph from draw.io in PNG format, with settings if possible as outlined above.
