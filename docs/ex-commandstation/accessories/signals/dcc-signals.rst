Important considerations for DCC accessory signals
==================================================

Before connecting DCC accessory signals, you will need to read the manufacturer's information on how they should be connected, to understand the default DCC address in use, and how to change the address.

You will also need to be aware that should a short circuit occur on the track, resulting in the |EX-CS| turning the track power off, any DCC accessories obtaining power and DCC commands from the track will not be able to be operated.

Connecting the signals
======================

While DCC accessories are typically connected to a track in order to successfully receive DCC commands, you will need to refer to the manufacturer's documentation on how this is accomplished for the particular brand and model of DCC accessory signals you are using.
