These pages describe the major supported hardware options for building a |EX-CS|, along with some guidance for some of the unsupported options. They are primarily targeted at |tinkerer-text| and |engineer-text| level.  However there are some options that are suitable for a |conductor-text|.  If however, you identify as a |conductor-text| and only wish to install the recommended hardware we suggest that you look at the simplified :doc:`/ex-commandstation/get-started/index` page.


Steps to Build an EX-CommandStation
===================================

#. Choose a `Microcontroller <Microcontrollers>`_
#. Choose a `Motor Driver <Motor Drivers>`_
#. Choose a `Connection Method <Connection Options>`_ and if required choose a:

  #. WiFi board,
  #. Ethernet board,
  #. Bluetooth board, 
  #. Or none of the above (Direct Connection)

#. Choose a `LCD/oLED screen <LED/oLED Screens>`_ (if desired)
#. Choose a `Controller (throttle) <Controller Options>`_
#. Choose an `installation method <Installation options>`_
#. Set your `startup options <Startup Configuration>`_ (if required)
#. `Install the software <Installation options>`_
#. Run your trains

Microcontrollers
================

There are several different supported microcontrollers you can use as your |EX-CS|.
