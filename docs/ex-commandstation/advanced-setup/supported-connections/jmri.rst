Connection Type: Direct to Command Station through JMRI
=======================================================

If you prefer to use, or need some features of, |JMRi|, then you can use |JMRi| to connect directly to your |EX-CS| via the USB connection, and then connect your controller(s) to |JMRi|.

To enable this functionality, |JMRi| includes a |WiThrottle| server.

For example, |Engine Driver| uses the |WiThrottle Protocol|, so it can connect through the JMRI computer that has WiFi and its own |WiThrottle Server|. This should also apply to any other controller that supports the |WiThrottle Protocol|.

You can read further on connecting your controller to |JMRi| on the `JMRI: WiFi Connected Throttle <https://www.jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/withrottle/UserInterface.shtml>`_ page on the |JMRi| website.

Some reasons you may wish to use |JMRi| with your |EX-CS|:

* You wish to connect more than 4 controllers to your |EX-CS| via WiFi
* You wish to use DecoderPro for programming your DCC decoders
* You wish to use the features available in PanelPro to display various graphical representations of your layout
* You wish to control multiple DCC controllers from the same interface
