What is EX-CommandStation?
==========================

A basic |EX-CS| can be made from widely available Arduino boards that you can assemble yourself. It supports much of the NMRA Digital Command Control (DCC) standards, including:

* Simultaneous control of multiple locomotives
* Control of all cab functions
* Control of accessory/function decoders
* Programming on Main Track
* Programming Track

It includes advanced features such as:

* A WiThrottle server implementation, 
* General purpose inputs and outputs (I/O) for extensibility, and 
* |JMRI| integration
