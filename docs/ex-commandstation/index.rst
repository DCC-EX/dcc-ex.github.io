What is EX-CommandStation?
==========================

An |EX-CS| is simple, but powerful, DCC, and DC, Command Station software which runs on the |EX-CSB1| or on hardware that you can assemble yourself made using widely available Arduino or ESPDuino32 boards. It supports much of the NMRA Digital Command Control (DCC) standards, including:

* Simultaneous control of multiple locomotives and their functions
* Control of accessory/function decoders
* Programming Track
* Programming on Main Track

It includes advanced features such as:

* A |WiThrottle Server| implementation, 
* General purpose inputs and outputs (I/O) for extensibility, and 
* |JMRI| integration
* |EX-RAIL| Automation and Animation scripting that can control everything on your layout, including the locos

It also supports:

* Direct Current (DC) locomotive control using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
