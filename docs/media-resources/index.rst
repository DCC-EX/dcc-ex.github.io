Making videos or Live Demos
============================

There are a few tools that can help you include live shots of throttles running on your computer, here are two great solutions

EX-WebThrottle
---------------

You can run EX-WebThrottle on any Chromium-based browser (like Chrome or Edge) in a window and take advantage of a simple USB cable connection from the computer to the |EX-CS|

You can find the instructions for using EX-WebThrottle here: :doc:`/ex-commandstation/get-started\testing`

BlueStack Android Emulator
---------------------------

Engine Driver is arguably the premier phone throttle app available, especially when considering all of its enhancements and features specifically tailored for the |EX-CS|. But what if you don't have an Android phone? Or what if you just want to use your computer without having to connect a phone? That is where an Android Emulator like BlueStack comes in. All you need is a Google account and to download the free BlueStack program. Once installed, you can download virtually any Android software, like Engine Driver, from the Google Play Store and run it on your computer, no phone necessary.

If you want to give public clinics you can display screens on a touchscreen laptop, computer with mouse, large display, or a video projector. If you are producing videos, this method can let you run everything from one computer.

The following image is a Windows computer running multiple "instances" of Engine Driver on the same computer.

All ED screens function the same as on the Android Smartphone except they are running on your computer. You can even "swipe" the screens back and forth to get to routes and CV programming modes. Imagine making an Operational Dispatcher Station to manage the Track Ids and assignments on a 32" monitor!

Another great features is that both the presenter's Engine Driver throttle running on a computer and connected via WiFi to the |EX-CS| and participants using their held ED smartphone throttle can all work together at the same time.

Using remote meeting software like Zoom or WebEx, you can show/demo and CS or Throttle functionality to a group.
