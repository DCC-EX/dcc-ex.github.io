Another way you can support the DCC-EX Project is to buy our DCC-EX branded merchandise, EX-Merch! Show everyone you are part of our team. There are several items to choose from in various sizes and colors:

* Regular T-Shirts
* Premium T-Shirts
* Women's T-Shirts
* Long Sleeve T-Shirts
* Pullover Hoodies
* Baseball Hats
* Toboggans (winter hats)
* Mugs
* Stickers

NOTE: There are 3 styles of shirts, plain back, "I'm a DCC-EX Tinkerer" on the back, and "I'm a DCC-EX Engineer" on the back. Be careful to choose the style you want. Shirts with printing on the back cost slightly more.

Here is an example listing for shirts where you need to choose the correct description for either a blank back or the "Tinkerer" or "Engineer" printing on the back
