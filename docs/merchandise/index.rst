Another way you can support the DCC-EX Project is to buy our Merch! Show everyone you are part of our team. There are several items to choose from:

* Regular T-Shirts
* Premium T-Shirts
* Women's T-Shirts
* Long Sleeve T-Shirts
* Pullover Hoodies
* Baseball Hats
* Toboggans (winter hats)
* Mugs
* Stickers

NOTE: There are 3 styles of shirts, plain back, "I'm a DCC-EX Tinkerer" on the back, and "I'm a DCC-EX Engineer" on the back. Be careful to choose the style you want. Shirts with printing on the back cost slightly more.
