Belated Happy New Year and a new EX-Installer!
==============================================

Firstly, we wish all our users a rather belated Happy New Year as we present our first DCC-EX News article for 2024! The news today is we have released an updated version of our |EX-I| (version 0.0.17).

This release includes the below changes, and as always we encourage you to download this latest version of :ref:`download/ex-commandstation:ex-installer` from our downloads page:

- Improved how we handle fonts across different Operating Systems
- Update various Python module versions to resolve security vulnerabilities
- Remove the option to select Arduino Nano with the old bootloader, as this has never worked
- Prevent enabling WiFi for |EX-CS| on the Arduino Uno/Nano platforms as they don't have enough memory
- Set the default CV programming option in |EX-CS| to enabled for the Arduino Uno/Nano platforms
- Change the |EX-CS| start with power on option to use |EX-R| ``POWERON`` instead of ``JOIN``
- Add the ability to override local changes made to |EX-CS|, |EX-IO|, and |EX-TT| software instead of just generating an error
- Allow a blank WiFi password in STA mode
