Another new EX-Installer release
================================

The |DCC-EX| team is pleased to announce another new release of |EX-I| (version 0.0.18). As always, we encourage all users to download this new version of the installer to take advantage of the bug fixes and new features available.

The key updates in this release are support for the new options available in |EX-TT| version 0.7.0, and the ability to save the device logs from the Device Monitor screen directly within |EX-I|. This way, when interacting with the |DCC-EX| team in Discord or via either means, when asked to provide the startup logs or serial monitor logs, you can simply open Device Monitor and click the ``Save log`` button to obtain these.

This release also includes the below changes:

- Update a Python module version to resolve security vulnerabilities
- Add a link to |DCC-EX| News articles about |EX-I| to the Info menu
- Ensure the "Backup config files" popup is always launched within the app window geometry
- Fix a bug where copying existing config files for |EX-TT| and |EX-IO| causes an exception
