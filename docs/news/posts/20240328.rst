Announcing EX-CommandStation 5.4.0
==================================

The |DCC-EX| team are excited to announce a new Production release of |EX-CS| with version 5.4.0 being made available today.

As usual, our next release includes a raft of new features and enhancements to bring even more capability and joy to your digital model railroading experience!

Just check out this list of features and enhancements added since our last release:

- Add a new turntable object so these can be operated from throttles just like turnouts, including |EX-R| commands for automation
- Added Beta auto reverser and booster mode for the ESP32 platform
- Add the ability to delay startup of your |EX-CS| to allow peripheral devices to start first
- Various HAL enhancements, including our native, non-blocking |I2C| capability for the STM32 Nucleo platform
- Add support for variable DC frequency with TrackManager, using function keys 29 - 31 to set it
- Add support to broadcast route/automation state changes to throttles
