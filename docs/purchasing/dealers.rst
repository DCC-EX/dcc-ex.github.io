************************************
DCC-EX Official Dealers / Resellers
************************************

With the ever increasing demand for hardware that is guaranteed to be |DCC-EX| compatible, and the uptake of |EX-CS| by more |conductor| level users, we are striving to make the |DCC-EX| ecosystem more accessible.

As part of that, and starting with the release of the |EX-MS|, we have a number of official |DCC-EX| dealers that can supply various different hardware devices as well as complete |EX-CS| systems.

The dealers listed on this page work with the |DCC-EX| team to ensure these devices are compatible.
