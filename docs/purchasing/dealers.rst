************************************
DCC-EX Official Dealers / Resellers
************************************

With the ever increasing demand for hardware that is guaranteed to be |DCC-EX| compatible, and the uptake of |EX-CS| by more |conductor| level users, we are striving to make the |DCC-EX| ecosystem more accessible.

As part of that, and starting with the release of the |EX-MS|, we have a number of official |DCC-EX| dealers that can supply various different hardware devices as well as complete |EX-CS| systems.

The dealers listed on this page work with the |DCC-EX| team to ensure these devices are compatible.

.. tip::

   If you are not in any of these countries, be aware that each dealer can usually ship anywhere in the world. Each dealer's primary territory is listed, so purchase from the one closest to you to save on shipping and duty charges.
