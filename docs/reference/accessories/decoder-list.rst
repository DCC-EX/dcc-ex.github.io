List of Tested Decoders
=======================

We often receive reports on DCC multifunction decoders via Discord and our support channels as well as requests for help when things don't quite work "out of the box".

As a result, we've started compiling a list of decoders that we've experienced with a view to helping people get up and running quicker with their DCC layouts.

The table below is a growing list of multifunction decoders we've had reasons to support or test for ourselves with various supporting information, and a rating from one to three stars on how easy it is to use and program them.

* Brand - The brand/manufacturer of the decoder.
* Model - The specific model or part number of the decoder.
* Type:

  * Multifunction.
  * Multifunction with sound.
  * Accessory.
  * Sound only.
* Firmware - The specific version of firmware on the decoder when tested.
* Connector:

  * NEM651.
  * NEM652.
  * 21MTC.
  * PLUX8/12/16/22.
  * N/A (bare wires).
* ACK Settings - Specific settings to enable correct ACK behaviour for service mode programming.
* Rating:

  * Rating is out of 3, purely from the perspective of compabitibility and ease of use getting them working and programming specifically with DCC++ EX. No consideration is given to how easy or complicated these are to install as the use cases vary too widely.
  * 1/3 - Can be quite difficult or complicated to get working or testing had inconsistent results.
  * 2/3 - Works as expected, with some extra effort required such as unique ACK settings.
  * 3/3 - Works exactly as expected.
* Comments - Any other relevant information discovered during testing or support tickets.

Note to manufacturers: This list is not designed in any way to disparage manufacturers, and is simply a factual observation of what the DCC++ EX team have noted while helping people get up and running with various DCC decoders.
