Hans has created a stacking system of cases similar to the M5Stack system. Using his skill in design and TinkerCAD, he is offering the design files for free for you to 3D print yourself or have printed. He also sells kits and accessories (like a Loconet board) in his Tindie store:

* UNO Stackable Case
* MotorShield Stackable Case

There are various remixes of Hans' designs, so be sure to check them all out.
