List of Tested Decoders
=======================

We often receive reports on DCC multifunction decoders via Discord and our support channels as well as requests for help when things don't quite work "out of the box".

As a result, we've started compiling a list of decoders that we've experienced with a view to helping people get up and running quicker with their DCC layouts.

The table below is a growing list of multifunction decoders we've had reasons to support or test for ourselves with various supporting information, and a rating from one to three stars on how easy it is to use and program them.

* Brand - The brand/manufacturer of the decoder.
* Model - The specific model or part number of the decoder.
* Firmware - The specific version of firmware on the decoder when tested.
* Connector - NEM561, N/A if it is just bare wires.
* Capabilities - .
* ACK - .
* Rating - .
* Comments - .

Note to manufacturers: This list is not designed in any way to disparage manufacturers, and is simply a factual observation of what the DCC++ EX team have noted while helping people get up and running with various DCC decoders.
