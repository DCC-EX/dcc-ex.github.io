DCC-EX supports both wired and wireless network connections. We will discuss using a wired Ethernet connection here. To connect using a WiFi board, see the `Wifi Boards Section <wifi-boards>`_


Arduino Network Shield 2
==========================

There have been different revisions for the Arduino Network Shields, the main difference is the version of the WiFi chip on the board. The "2" board uses the Wiznet W5500, other versions used the older W5100 chip. The only supported chip currently is the W5500, but the other boards may work as well.

The Wiznet W5100 provides a network (IP) stack capable of both TCP and UDP, and supports up to four simultaneous socket connections. This board also has an SDCard which can be used for your own custom features or for storing settings with a future version of DCC++ EX
