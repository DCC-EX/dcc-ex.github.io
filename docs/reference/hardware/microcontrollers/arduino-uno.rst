Arduino Uno Setup
*******************

|conductor|

If you already have an Uno, or will use |JMRI| to control your trains, then by all means use an Uno. Just remember that you can't have WiFi, Ethernet or a few other options due to memory limitations. But as a Command Station connected to |JMRI| with a USB cable it works great.

Setting up the UNO is essentially the same as setting up a Mega, so refer to the :doc:`/ex-commandstation/get-started/assembly` page for information on setting up this microcontroller.
