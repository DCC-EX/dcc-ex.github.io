DIY More L298NH Motor Shield
****************************

|conductor|

.. note:: 

   This board is compatible with |TM| DC mode.

Another similar board to the Arduino motor shield. Supports 2A per channel. This board uses the L298HN, which is the same L298 internally as the Arduino Motor Shield but in a different form factor with a larger heat sink tab. Current sense and other features are identical to the Arduino version.
