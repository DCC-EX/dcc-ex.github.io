**This is a summary, for a detailed command, see...**
  :doc:`Command Reference <command-reference>`

This page describes all the DCC-EX commands that the |EX-CS| supports.

Conventions used on this page
=============================

- ``<`` and ``>`` - All DCC-EX commands are surrounded by these characters to indicate the beginning and end, these must always be included
- First letter or number - These are called OPCODES, are case sensitive, and must be specified as directed, eg. ``1``, ``c``, or ``-``
- CAPITALISED words - These are parameters referred to as keywords, and should be specified as directed, eg. ``MAIN`` (note these are not case sensitive, however capitalising makes them easier to distinguish from other parameters)
- lowercase words - These are parameters that must be provided or are returned, with multiple parameters separated by a space " ", eg. ``cab``
- Square brackets ``[]`` - Parameters within square brackets ``[]`` are optional and may be omitted, and if specifying these parameters, do not include the square brackets themselves
- \| - Use of the \| character means you need to provide one of the provided options only, for example ``<0|1 MAIN|PROG|JOIN>`` becomes either ``<0 MAIN>`` or ``<1 MAIN>``
- ``0|1`` DIRECTION: 1=forward, 0=reverse.

  * - Command
    - Description / Response
  * - ``<onOff [track]>``
    - **Turns power on and off to the MAIN and PROG tracks together or independently. Also allows joining the MAIN and PROG tracks together.** |BR|
      Parameters: |BR|
      onOff: |BR|
      |_|   1 = on |BR|
      |_|   0 = off |BR|
      track: |BR|
      |_|   blank = Both Main and Programming Tracks  |BR|
      |_|   MAIN = Main track  |BR|
      |_|   PROG = Programming Track  |BR|
      |_|   JOIN = Join the Main and Programming tracks temporarily |BR|
      |BR|
      e.g. |BR|
      all tracks off: **<0>** |BR|
      all tracks on **<1>** |BR|
      join: **<1 JOIN>** |BR| |BR|
      Response: |BR|
      N/A
      Noes: |BR|
      The use of the JOIN function ensures that the DCC signal for the MAIN track is also sent to the PROG track. This allows the prog track to act as a siding (or similar) in the main layout even though it is isolated electrically and connected to the programming track output. However, it is important that the prog track wiring be in the same phase as the main track i.e. when the left rail is high on MAIN, it is also high on PROG. You may have to swap the wires to your prog track to make this work. If you drive onto a programming track that is “joined” and enter a programming command, the track will automatically switch to a programming track. If you use a compatible Throttle, you can then send the join command again and drive off the track onto the rest of your layout! |BR|
      |BR|
      In some split motor shield hardware configurations JOIN will not be able to work.

  * - Command
    - Description / Response 
  * - ``<t reg cab speed dir>``

      |_|   1=forward  |BR|
      |_|   0=reverse |BR| |BR|
      Response: |BR|
      The following is not a direct response, but rather as a broadcast that will be triggered as a result of any throttle command being issued by any devise for the cab(loc) in question. |BR|
      |BR|
      **<l cab reg speedByte functMap>** |BR|

      Notes:  |BR|
      - The speedbyte value will appear different to the speed sent, as it is an encoded (1,7 bits)  byte |BR|
      - This starts a reminder process for any external updates to the cab's (loco's) status.
      Version Introduced: 4.1.1
  * - ``<t cab>``
    - **Requests a deliberate update on the cab speed/functions in the same format as the cab (loco) broadcast.** |BR|
      Parameters: |BR|
      cab: DCC Address of the decoder/loco |BR| |BR|

      - This starts a reminder process for any external updates to the cab's (loco's) status.
  * - ``<- [cab]>``
    - **Remove one or all locos from reminders** |BR|
      Parameters: |BR|
      cab: |BR|
      |_|   blank = all locos  |BR|
      |_|   No. = Cab (loco) to forget |BR| |BR|
      Response: |BR|
      N/A
      Notes: |BR|
      Forgets one or all locos. The “cab” parameter is optional.  |BR|
      Once you send a throttle command to any loco, throttle commands to that loco will continue to be sent to the track. If you remove the loco, or for testing purposes need to clear the loco from repeating messages to the track, you can use this command. Sending **<- cab>** will forget/clear that loco. Sending **<->** will clear all the locos. This doesn't do anything destructive or erase any loco settings, it just clears the speed reminders from being sent to the track. As soon as a controller sends another throttle command, it will go back to repeating those commands.
  * - ``<!>``
    - **Emergency Stop** |BR|
      Parameters: |BR|
      N/A |BR| |BR|
      Response: |BR|

    - **Turns loco decoder functions ON and OFF** |BR|
      Parameters: |BR|
      cab: DCC Address of the decoder/loco |BR|
      funct: 0-28 (F29-F68 (Support for the RCN-212 Functions) |BR|

      |_|   1=on  |BR|
      |_|   0=off |BR|
      |BR|
      NOTES: |BR|
      - Setting requests are transmitted directly to mobile engine decoder. |BR|
      - Current state of engine functions (as known by commands issued since power on) is stored by the CommandStation - All functions within a group get set all at once per NMRA DCC standards. |BR| |BR|
      Response: |BR|
      **<l cab reg speedByte functMap>** |BR|
      |BR|
      
      Noes: |BR|
      Current state of engine functions (as known by commands issued since power on) is stored by the CommandStation |BR|
      All functions within a group get set all at once per NMRA DCC standards. |BR|
      Using the new F command, the command station knows about the previous settings in the same group and will not, for example, unset F2 because you change F1. If, however, you have never set F2, then changing F1 WILL unset F2.

  * - ``<#>``
    - **Show number of supported cabs(locos)** |BR|
      Parameters: |BR|
      N/A |BR| |BR|
      Response: |BR|
      **<# noCabs>** |BR|
      noCabs: maximum number of Cabs(Locos) supported by the command station |BR|
      |BR|
      Will return one of **<# 20>**, **<# 30>**, or **<# 50>**
      Noes: |BR|
      Will display the number of available cab slots. This will typically be **<# 20>**, **<# 30>**, or **<# 50>** depending on how much memory your EX‑CommandStation has available.  |BR|
      This is a design limit based on the memory limitations of the particular hardware and a compromise with other features that require memory such as WiFI. If you need more slots and are comfortable with code changes you can adjust this by changing MAX_LOCOS in “DCC.h”, knowing that each new slot will take approximately 8 bytes of memory. The **<D RAM>** command will display the amount of free memory. If you fill the available slots, the “Forget Locos” command (**<- [CAB]>**) will free up unused locos. Currently there is no automatic purging of unused locos.

Diagnostic programming commands

  :class: command-table

  * - Command
    - Description / Response 
  * - ``<D ACK LIMIT mA>``
    - **Sets the ACK limit** |BR|
      The Ack current limit is set according to the DCC standard(s) of 60mA. Most decoders send a quick back and forth current pulse to the motor to generate this ACK. However, some modern motors (N and Z scales) may not be able to draw that amount of current. You can adjust down this limit. Or, if for some reasons your acks seem to be too “trigger happy” you can make it less sensitive by raising this limit. |BR| |BR|
      Response (successful): |BR|
      Response (fail):  |BR|
      :ref:`Also see <D ACK LIMIT>`
  * - ``<D ACK MIN µS>``
    - **Sets the ACK pulse minimum** |BR| 
      The NMRA specifies that the ACK pulse duration should be 6 milliseconds, which is 6000 microseconds (µS), give or take 1000 µS. That means the minimum pulse duration is 5000 µS and the maximum is 7000 µS. There are many poorly designed decoders in existence so DCC-EX extends this range from 4000 to 8500 µS. If you have any decoders that still do not function within this range, you can adjust the ACK MIN and ACK MAX parameters. |BR| |BR|
      Response (successful): |BR|
      Response (fail):  |BR|
  * - ``<D ACK MAX µS>``
    - **Sets the ACK pulse maximum** |BR| |BR|
      Response (successful): |BR|

      Response (successful): |BR|
      Response (fail):  |BR|
  * - ``<D PROGBOOST>``
    - **Override 250mA prog track limit while idle** |BR| 
      When the programming track is switched on with <1> or <1 PROG> it will normally be restricted to 250mA according to NMRA standards. Some loco decoders require more than this, especially sound versions. **<D PROGBOOST>** temporarily removes this limit to allow the decoder to use more power. The normal limit will be re-imposed when the programming track is switched off with **<0>** or **<0 PROG>** or the Command Station is reset. |BR| |BR|
