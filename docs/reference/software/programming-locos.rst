Programming Locos (CVs)

Requirements
=============

* A DCC Enabled loco with a working Decoder
* A separate section of track or a siding electrically isolated from the main track
* A motor shield or motor driver with current sense capability

.. NOTE:: The default EX-CommandStation with a dual output Arduino Motor shield has everything you need, a main track output, a programming track output, and a configuration that handles current sense for programming a loco on output B and current sense for overlimit detection on output A.

.. TODO:: URGENT - Get help with this. We should have had this long ago.  (see Big-picture - Stage 1)
