Release Notes
==============

Rather than try to maintain release notes in multiple places, we provide a link below to the original file on our GitHub page. You can read the file there or download it. If you already have installed the Command Station sketch to your local machine, you will have the release notes for the version you downloaed in your CommandStation-EX project folder. Click on the link below for our most current release notes.

.. NOTE:: Note that this will show the release notes for the latest "master" build that you can download and install and may contain changes that are not in the last "official" release. The master version is the current stable version, while the official release is the one bundled and installed from the installer and downloaded from the download link.
