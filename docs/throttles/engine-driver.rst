Engine Driver is an Android App that uses the WiThrottle Protocol to either connect directly to the DCC++ EX Command Station or connect to the JMRI WiThrottle Server. If you connect Engine Driver to JMRI, you connect the computer running JMRI to the Command Station using a USB cable. If you connect Engine Driver directly to DCC++ EX, you connect using Wifi. See `WiFi Setup <../get-started/wifi-setup>`_
