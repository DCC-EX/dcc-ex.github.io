Note, this is a "project" type throttle and requires the user to construct it to their specifications

* Open source software free for hobbyist use
* esp32 based 
* Supports both the DCC-EX and JMRI protocols
* Display support
* LED status indicators
* 3v voltmeter for speedometer and brake pressure
* support for a keypad, rotary encoder or potentiometer for throttle, forward/reverse switch,
* Serial console allows WiFi network affinity and other settings to be changed without having to re-program the micro controller
* Multiple WiFi networks allowing the throttle to be portable and used on multiple layouts. Alternatively a direct serial connection to|EX-CS| may be used, which bypasses WiFi connectivity.
