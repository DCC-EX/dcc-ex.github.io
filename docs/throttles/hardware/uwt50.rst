   UTW-50 Throttle
   
Train Control Systems (TCS) makes a nice line of physical tactile hardware based controllers. 
Since they support the |WiThrottle protocol|, they work seemlessly with the |EX-CS|. 
Recently preliminary testing on both the UWT-50 and the UWT-100 WiFi Throttles are very encouraging.

Some of the major benefits of |EX-CS| for TCS UWT-Throttle users are;

* JMRI WiThrottle Server Protocol compliant.
* Direct WiFi connection of TCS UWT-Throttles to the |EX-CS|. (|WiThrottle protocol| is built into DCC-EX EX-Command Station.  No JMRI connection is required.)
* Both DCC & DC Layouts can use TCS UWT-WiFi Throttles, and other smartphone WiFi Throttle Apps, together with |DCC-EX| and our TrackManager feature.

The |EX-CS| has the ability to automatically upload EXRAIL Automation, Routes & Command macros to the TCS UWT-Throttles.
