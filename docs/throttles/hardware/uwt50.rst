Train Control Systems (TCS) makes a nice line of physical tactile hardware based controllers. 
Since they support the |WiThrottle protocol|, they work seemlessly with the |EX-CS|. 
Recently preliminary testing on both the UWT-50 and the UWT-100 WiFi Throttles are very encouraging.

Some of the major benefits of |EX-CS| for TCS UWT-Throttle users are;

* Direct WiFi connection of TCS UWT-Throttles to the |EX-CS|.
* |WiThrottle protocol| built into DCC-EX EX-Command Station giving access to all the EXRAIL macro scripts.  No JMRI connection required
* EXRAIL macros run on the Command Station and do not need a PC connected in order to operate engines and accessories on the layout.
* JMRI WiThrottle Server Protocol compliant
* JMRI Routes can be created to point to existing EXRAIL macros residing on DCC-EX  and be run through the WiThrottle Server connection
* EXRAIL scripts are simpler more powerful & easier to write than JMRI Jython/Python.py scripts.
* Both DCC & DC Layouts can use TCS UWT-WiFi Throttles and other smartphone WiFi Throttle Apps together with DCC-EX and our new TrackManager.

The |EX-CS| has the ability to automatically upload EXRAIL Automation, Routes & Command macros to the TCS UWT-Throttles.
