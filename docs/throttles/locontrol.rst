This iOS App is simply beautiful, but you would expect this from a team of talented people consisting of an artist/graphic designer, an iOS Developer, and a User Interface (UI) Designer.

Today, you can use Locontrol on an iOS device connected to JMRI throuth its Web Interface. JMRI then connects to DCC++EX with a USB cable or wireless USB bridge.

We are currently working with the Locontrol folks to work directly with DCC++ EX without the need for external software. Come back soon for more information. In the meantime, please visit their website https://www.locontrol.com
