A DCC-EX Native command protocol library is available to help develop throttle apps on Arduino (primarily ESP32) hardware.

The library implements the DCC-EX Native command protocol (as used in the |DCC-EX| |EX-CS| ONLY), allowing a device to connect to the server and act as a client (such as a hardware based throttle).

Details of the library, including instructions and examples, `is available here <https://dcc-ex.com/DCCEXProtocol/index.html>`_.
