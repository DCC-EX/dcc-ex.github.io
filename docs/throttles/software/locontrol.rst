This iOS App is simply beautiful, but you would expect this from a team of talented people consisting of an artist/graphic designer, an iOS Developer, and a User Interface (UI) Designer.

Today, you can use Locontrol on an iOS device connected to |JMRI| through its Web Interface. |JMRI| then connects to |EX-CS| with a USB cable or wireless USB bridge.

We are currently working with the Locontrol folks to work directly with |EX-CS| without the need for external software. Come back soon for more information. In the meantime, please visit their website https://www.locontrol.com |EXTERNAL-LINK|

`Get it on the Apple App Store <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/locontrol-dcc-controller/id1473757920>`_ |EXTERNAL-LINK|
