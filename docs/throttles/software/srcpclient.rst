This is an iOS App from Germany. One of the major benefits of SRCPClient is that it speaks the <DCC++> Application Programming language (API) natively (see our :doc:`Command Reference </reference/software/command-reference>`). This means it is fast and can take advantage of some features that exist in the DCC++ EX Command Station not implemented in other APIs. Is also can connect to a WiThrottle server so you can use it with JMRI too.

You can find it in the App Store: `SRCP Client for iOS <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/srcpclient/id1495402734>`_
