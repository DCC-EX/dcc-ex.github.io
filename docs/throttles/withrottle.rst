This is an iOS App (with plans for iOS) from the USA. WiThrottle is probably the most popular iOS throttle since early on JMRI built a WiThrottle Server into its program. You can connect WiThrottle to JMRI and connect JMRI to DCC++EX, or you if you are not going to use JMRI, you can connect directly to the CS if you install a WiFi board.

Please visit their website: https://www.withrottle.com

You can find it in the App Store: `WiThrottle <http://itunes.apple.com/app/id344172578>`_

For more information more information about these protocols, see :doc:`WiThrottle Server, Web Server, DCC++ API Explained <protocols>`
