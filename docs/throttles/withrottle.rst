WiThrottle Server (Engine Driver, etc.)
=======================================

DCC++ EX allows you to use WiThrottle "servers" built into JMRI and other software and have them connect to your Command Station, but DCC-EX also implements a WiThrottle server in the Command Station software itself. That means you can directly connect a WiThrottle compatible Throttle (aka CAB) via Wifi or Bluetooth to the CS and run trains.

Connecting WiThrottle is relatively easy. You must disable the ability for your iOS device to automatically connect to your home network otherwise it will constantly disconnect from the CS and connect back to your router instead.
