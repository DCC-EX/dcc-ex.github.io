<h1>Choosing a Controller (Throttle)<a class="headerlink" href="#choosing-a-controller-throttle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>You need just two things that work together to operate your model railroad:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The DCC++ EX Command Station</p></li>
<li><p>A Controller (aka Frontend, aka CAB, aka Throttle)</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="the-command-station">
<h2>The Command Station<a class="headerlink" href="#the-command-station" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The CS is covered in the <a class="reference external" href="get-started.html">getting started</a> section and is usually an Arduino microcontroller and a motor shield or motor board. The CS accepts instructions from a controller and generates packets that are transmitted to your track.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-controller">
<h2>The Controller<a class="headerlink" href="#the-controller" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since the CS just accepts &lt;DCC++&gt; commands, you need something that sends those commands to run your trains - a controller. It isn’t very practical to type &lt;t 1 3 75 1&gt; into a serial monitor to tell your train to move ;)  A controller can be a hardware device like a handheld throttle (also called a CAB), or front-end software like JMRI or Rocrail. Here are a few of the methods you can use to control your layout.</p>
<div class="section" id="our-webthrottle-ex">
<h3>Our WebThrottle-EX<a class="headerlink" href="#our-webthrottle-ex" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The simplest option is to just use a throttle connected directly to the CS. The simplest of all is arguably WebThrottle-EX connected via a USB cable from your computer and web browser directly to the Command Station. You have control of multiple locomotives and can operate turnouts. There is a way to replace the USB cable with a wireless connection, but we will cover that later in the Wireless USB Bridge section. Below is a picture of WT-EX with the side menu open. You can click on the image to see it full size.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/webthrottle1.jpg"><img alt="WebThrottle-EX" class="align-center" src="../_images/webthrottle1.jpg" style="width: 546.4px; height: 307.20000000000005px;" /></a>
<p>Here are your connections, just a computer running a chromium-based browser, a USB cable, and your Command Station.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/webthrottle_setup.jpg"><img alt="WebThrottle-EX" class="align-center" src="../_images/webthrottle_setup.jpg" style="width: 818.1px; height: 272.7px;" /></a>
<p>For operating instructions see <a class="reference external" href="../throttles/ex-webthrottle.html">how to use WebThrottle-EX</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="engine-driver-android">
<h3>Engine Driver (Android)<a class="headerlink" href="#engine-driver-android" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Engine Driver is a throttle app for your phone that can control multiple locos and your turnouts. It uses an interface called “WiThrottle” (for WiFi Throttle) and any WiThrottle compatible throttle will work with DCC++ EX. There are two ways to connect it; the first method is by connecting directly to the CS via WiFi. You will need a WiFI board connected to the CS (see Wifi Setup <a class="reference external" href="wifi-setup.html">WiFi Setup</a>).</p>
<p><strong>*insert diagram here*</strong></p>
<p>The second method is to use JMRI and connect Engine Driver (ED) to the computer running JMRI. That computer would then connect to the CS via a USB cable (normally) or via a Wireless USB Bridge. The computer running JMRI can be just about any type of computer, PC, Mac, Raspberry Pi, but most operators like the Pi option because it is inexpensive, small, can mount under the layout, and has a free image file that lets you flash it to a Micro-SD card and have a fill JMRI setup with WiFi with virtually no fuss.</p>
<p>See <a class="reference external" href="../throttles/withrottle.html">How to use Engine Driver (WiThrottle)</a></p>
<p><strong>*insert diagram here*</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dccpp-cab-android">
<h3>DCCpp CAB (Android)<a class="headerlink" href="#dccpp-cab-android" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>DCCpp CAB is throttle that natively speaks the &lt;DCC++&gt; command language (API). It can connect via WiFi or Bluetooth! If you don’t need software like JMRI running on a computer, DCCpp CAB lets you connect directly to the CS.</p>
<p>See <a class="reference external" href="../throttles/dccpp-cab.html">How to use DCCpp CAB</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="withrottle-ios">
<h3>WiThrottle (iOS)<a class="headerlink" href="#withrottle-ios" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Withrottle is an app for iPhones and iPads, it can connect directly to the CS like Engine Driver does or connect to JMRI on a computer and then have JMRI connect to the CS via a USB cable.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="locontrol-ios">
<h3>Locontrol (iOS)<a class="headerlink" href="#locontrol-ios" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Locontrol is a beautiful and functional Throttle that connects that uses the JMRI Web Server to connect. Soon it will be able to connect directly to the CS by using the &lt;DCC++&gt; Command set.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="digitrainspro-android-ios-windows">
<h3>DigiTrainsPro (Android, iOS, Windows)<a class="headerlink" href="#digitrainspro-android-ios-windows" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is the only throttle with a Windows App. It also has a beautiful user interface. Soon it will be able to speak directly to DCC-EX using our command language.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="jmri">
<h3>JMRI<a class="headerlink" href="#jmri" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>JMRI is sort of the 800lb gorrilla of front ends. In its simplest form, it is a throttle, or a gateway to allow you to use Engine Driver or a mouse or touchscreen as a throttle without a WiFi board connected to the CS. The Wifi is built into the computer you use to run JMRI, and JMRI has a WiThrottle Server built into it. The computer running JMRI, in turn, connects to the CS with a USB cable. JMRI is a complex program. if you are seriously into your model railroading however, JMRI can provide a lot of value. It can handle your turnouts, outputs, and sensors. It lets you create rosters for you locos and a visual layout of your tracks. There isn’t much it can’t do. And is is free and open source, just like DCC++ EX.</p>
<div class="section" id="connecting-via-usb-cable">
<h4>Connecting Via USB cable<a class="headerlink" href="#connecting-via-usb-cable" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Probably the way most people use JMRI is to have a Raspberry Pi running JMRI connected via a short USB cable to the DCC++ EX Command Station. They then use Engine Driver on their phone connected to JMRI via Wifi as a throttle for their engines. If you want to actually operate using all the features or JMRI, you can connect a small monitor, keyboard and mouse to your computer or Raspberry Pi. You can replace the USB cable with a USB Wireless bridge which is covered in that section. But let’s look at another method next.</p>
<p><strong>**insert diagram here*</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="connecting-via-vnc">
<h4>Connecting Via VNC<a class="headerlink" href="#connecting-via-vnc" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>VNC stands for “Virtual Network Computing”, it is a way to access a device remotely. Variations of this are called “Remote Desktop” in Windows, Teamviewer, Anydesk, etc. It is free and it lets you take another device, like a tablet and have a viewport into the computer your are using to rund JMRI. It literally is a “remote desktop”. Everything is running on your computer or Raspberry Pi, yet you can control it from a handheld wireless device with a touchscreen.</p>

<div class="section" id="usb-wireless-bridge">
<h3>USB Wireless Bridge<a class="headerlink" href="#usb-wireless-bridge" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The USB Wireless Bridge is a pair of small, inexpensive devices that let you replace a USB cable with a wireless connection. You really could connect any two devices that would normally connect with a USB cable.The power of this system is that there is little or no configuration and no changes need to be made to your controller or the CS. In our world, here are some of the ways you can use it:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Connect WebThrottle-EX running on a laptop or tablet wirelessly to the DCC++ EX Command Station</p></li>
<li><p>Connect a computer or Raspberry Pi running JMRI (or another front end) to the Command Station</p></li>
<li><p>Connect normally tethered handheld CABS (throttles) wirelessly to the Command Station</p></li>
</ul>
